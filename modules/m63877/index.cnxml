Most chief executives in this country at one time or another have blamed the press—particularly newspapers—for their political problems. Historian Forrest McDonald claims that the first draft of George Washington's Farewell Address was such a diatribe against the press that Alexander Hamilton had to rewrite it.<sup>1</sup> Ronald Reagan, in one of his last speeches before leaving office, attributed his inability to reduce the huge federal deficit to an "iron triangle" of Congressmen, lobbyists, and journalists. </para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1167748235868">Reagan's characterization of the press is not unlike that of English historian Thomas Babington Macaulay, who dubbed the press the "Fourth Estate."<sup>2</sup> So important is the press to our form of government that it has been given constitutional protection. The framers of the Constitution believed that the press—which in those days consisted mainly of newspapers, newsletters, and pamphlets—was necessary to ensure an informed electorate and serve as the people's watchdogs on government. </para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1167745836880">Today, newspapers serve a variety of needs and form an important part of our mosaic environment. We depend more on our local papers than any other medium to stay informed of what is going on in our community, which stores have sales, what movie is playing where, and many other useful bits of knowledge. During the 1989 San Francisco earthquake, one survivor was quoted as saying: "Having a newspaper is like having a piece of gold."<sup>3 </sup></para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1167762653122">It is probably because they are so important that newspapers receive so much criticism. This criticism serves as a constant reminder of the needs of individuals and society that newspapers are expected to meet. An examination of some of the highlights in the history of newspapers, as well as of the ways newspapers operate, should help you weigh the criticism of present-day newspapers and, most important, to use and interpret more intelligently what you read in newspapers so they better serve your needs. </para><para id="import-auto-id1167744045713"><media id="newspapers_history_timeline" alt="A timeline of the history of newspapers.">

      <title>EARLY NEWSPAPER DEVELOPMENTS</title>
      <para id="import-auto-id1167748378339">The forerunner of the newspaper in America was the <emphasis effect="bold">newsletter</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">a short, periodic report for business and government leaders to keep them informed of shipping and financial transactions and important political events</emphasis>. Newsletters were written by professionals in the major government and business centers around the world. In addition to the newsletter, during the colonial days periodic pamphlets about important public questions were circulated. The more mundane news-hangings, the capture of a pirate, or local bits of gossip-was often put into poetic form and sung by balladeers to the cadence of some well-known tune. Regularly issued publications that could be termed newspapers had been published in Great Britain since at least 1565. A few of these found their way to the American colonies. Twenty-five years after the initial newspaper appeared in Britain, a similar publication was started in Boston. From the explicitness of its title, <emphasis effect="italics">Publick Occurrences Both Foreign and Domestick</emphasis>, we can see that newspapers were not familiar objects in the American colonies. The publisher promised to issue the paper once a month, "or if any Glut of Occurrences happen, oftener." Unfortunately, we have no way of knowing whether any "glut of occurrences" happened: the provincial Council and the King's Governor banned the paper after the publication of only one issue because the publisher had no license. The authorities made clear that nothing was to be printed and distributed in the future unless a license was first obtained from the government. </para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1167741507438">A year earlier, the government of Massachusetts began permitting the publication of an occasional news sheet titled <emphasis effect="italics">The Present State of New-English Affairs</emphasis>. Beneath that heading was the announcement that "This is Published to Prevent False Reports." </para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1167747038457">A longer-lived American newspaper was started in l704 by a bookseller and local postmaster named John Campbell. This was the weekly <emphasis effect="italics">Boston News-Letter</emphasis>. It had only one page, about the size of a standard sheet of today's typing paper, and was printed on both sides. It was generally a rather staid publication, except when reporting on pirates. The newspaper's most sensational story was its account of the slaying of the pirate Blackbeard during hand-to-hand combat on the deck of a ship. Then, as now, the line between information and entertainment in the news columns was not always clear. </para>

        <title>The Zenger Case </title>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167743906199">By 1735 there were five newspapers in Boston—a town that then had fewer than 20,000 people. One of the most important events connected with the early history of mass communication occurred that year in New York, then the third largest city in the colonies. A young immigrant named John Peter Zenger had started a newspaper there in 1733 called the <emphasis effect="italics">New York Weekly Journal</emphasis>. He was arrested because his newspaper championed the cause of people who challenged the authority of the Royal Governors. At the trial, which took place in 1735, he was represented by one of the most famous attorneys in the colonies, Andrew Hamilton. Hamilton's final words in his summation to the jury were eloquent in their defense of freedom of speech and the press: </para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167749561826"><quote id="eip-idm252382688">The question before the court and you gentlemen of the jury is not of small or private concern; it is not the cause of the poor printer, nor of New York, alone. No! It may, in its consequences, affect every freeman that lives under a British government on the main of America. It is the first cause. It is the cause of liberty . . . the liberty both of exposing and opposing arbitrary power by speaking and writing truth.<sup>4</sup></quote></para><para id="import-auto-id1167766481053">Although the Zenger trial, which led to an acquittal, set no legal precedent, it strongly influenced Americans' feelings about the importance of freedom of the press. </para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167748421454">Because of journalists such as Zenger, newspapers gained great prestige among the colonists during the revolutionary period, and after the war they spread rapidly. This expansion was due in part to the fact that the American press at that time had more freedom than the press anywhere else in the world. American newspapers flourished in the climate that had been created by the John Peter Zengers and the Thomas Paines and by the First Amendment. </para>

        <title>The Sedition Act</title>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167746577084">The First Amendment, however, did not resolve all problems of censorship in this new republic. Less than twenty years after the close of the Revolutionary War, when war with France was imminent, Congress attempted to still criticism of the administration by passing the Sedition Act. As explained in Chapter Three, this act specified that anyone who made a "false, scandalous, and malicious" statement against part of the government that was intended to defame it could be sent to prison for up to two years and fined up to $2000. </para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167744338355">Cases were brought against a number of publishers under the Sedition Act. One had accused Alexander Hamilton of promoting a scheme to buy and silence an opposition newspaper. Another was prosecuted for criticizing the Massachusetts legislature for not fighting the Alien and Sedition Acts. And yet another was fined and imprisoned for calling President john Adams an incompetent. </para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167750538294">One interesting and important aspect of the Sedition Act was the provision that "truth" was an adequate defense against the charge of sedition. A result of that provision was that the journalist who called President Adams incompetent attempted to get the president to appear as a witness at the trial so it could be proven that the charge was true. The court, however, refused to subpoena the president. </para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167749008737">This provision of the Sedition Act was important because the relevance of truth as a defense against censorship or prosecution is still an issue. In libel cases, for example, in which a newspaper is accused of harming someone's reputation, proving the truth of what was published is an adequate defense against prosecution in some states but not in others. This raises the more basic issue of whether "truth" or "responsibility" is a necessary condition of the freedom that the First Amendment gives to the press. The question is much debated, at least indirectly, these days. The position of the Supreme Court—so far—is that the First Amendment neither says nor suggests that the press must be truthful or responsible; it says only that it must be free. Thus, presumably, the press can be more courageous, acting without fear of charges that it erred or was irresponsible. </para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167750438730">However, this situation may be changing as news media more frequently are finding themselves charged with <emphasis effect="bold">libel</emphasis>—<emphasis effect="italics">publishing information that damages someone's </emphasis><emphasis effect="italics">reputation</emphasis>—and many juries and judges are not accepting the First Amendment as an adequate defense. Traditionally, the news media have had more freedom to criticize and report unfavorable information about a political figure or other persons in the news than they did to criticize or report unfavorably on ordinary citizens. This is still the case to some extent, although the distinction appears to be lessening.</para><para id="import-auto-id1167782132841"><emphasis effect="bold">REVIEW | </emphasis>The John Peter Zenger case and the Sedition Act are two examples of early attempts to control the press in America. </para>

If you disagree, would you rewrite the First Amendment? How? If you agree, does that mean that your local newspaper should be free to publish anything that it wishes about you, whether true or not? How can we balance freedom of the press with the rights of individuals to privacy and their good names? Where should freedom of the press end and the rights of individuals begin?</para>

        <title>Partisan Journalism </title>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167741546857">In the history of newspapers, there have been times when publishers were hardly concerned with truth or responsibility. The period from the eighteenth century through the early part of the nineteenth century was such a time. Throughout the eighteenth century, most journalists sprinkled their news stories with personal opinions and arguments, often with little regard for where facts ended and opinions began. The idea of journalistic “objectivity" had not yet become popular. For many journalists, a prime motivation in publishing a paper was the opportunity it gave them to circulate their opinions. One of the worst aspects of this lack of objectivity and the use of a newspaper for the wide circulation of a publisher's opinions was the practice of viciously attacking political opponents. Many of the attacks were quite personal, crude, and dishonest. Consider this news story, for example, published during Thomas Jefferson's campaign for the Presidency: </para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167742378864"><quote id="eip-id5274144">
Should the Infidel Jefferson be elected to the Presidency, the seal of death is that moment set on our holy religion, our churches will be prostrated, and some infamous prostitute, under the title of the Goddess of Reason, will preside in the Sanctuaries now devoted to the Most High.<sup>5</sup>
</quote></para><para id="import-auto-id1167748874665">This type of unobjective, partisan journalism reached its zenith in the early part of the nineteenth century. However, at the same time such newspaper attacks were at their worst, a seed was being planted that was destined to grow and eclipse this highly partisan style of journalism. That seed was the idea of editorial columns or pages, and the sower of the seed was Noah Webster, who later became famous for his dictionary. Webster began an editorial column in the newspaper he started in 1793, <emphasis effect="italics">The American Minerva</emphasis>. The ground was apparently ready for such seed, for by the time of the Civil War, editorial columns and pages were regular parts of a large percentage of American newspapers. </para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167750476344">This is not to suggest that any of the news media are, or can be, totally objective. As we have said, news is about events, people, or ideas; it is not the same thing as the events, people, or ideas. News is something <emphasis effect="italics">constructed</emphasis> by human beings with words and pictures, using their highly selective and limited knowledge of the world as the basis. The point, then, is not that news is either objective or unobjective but that most journalists today are more concerned about objectivity, fairness, and accuracy than they were a century ago. As a result, readers, listeners, and viewers are better served. </para>

        <title>Advertising </title>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167749284500">Advertising became important early in the history of the newspaper business. By the middle of the eighteenth century it was the chief difference between a newspaper being profitable and going broke. The <emphasis effect="italics">Boston News-Letter</emphasis> began carrying ads in 1704. By the time the Revolutionary War broke out in 1775, all 37 of the newspapers in the colonies contained them. A leading figure in the American Revolution, Benjamin Franklin, was also responsible for revolutionizing advertising. His newspaper, the <emphasis effect="italics">Pennsylvania Gazette</emphasis>, led the way toward making advertising more attractive through the imaginative use of space and more varied sorts of type. Prior to Franklin's time, all ads looked rather like the classified ads of today, run together in tightly packed columns of type. </para>

        <title>Speeding Up the News </title>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167751612195">You may be surprised to know that newspapers were not always as concerned with up-to-the-minute news as they are today. This value developed in the early part of the nineteenth century. Part of the problem, of course, was that technology for rapid transmission of information did not exist until fairly recent times. News from Europe came by sailing vessel, which meant it usually took about two months to get into print in America. Even American news took time to spread across the country. When George Washington died in 1799, it was two days before the news appeared in the newspaper in his hometown, and that was the first paper in the country to carry the story. Not until a week after his death was the story of our first president's death published in a New York newspaper; 11 days passed before one could read about it in Boston; almost a month went by before it appeared in Cincinnati. Compare this to the speed of diffusion of the assassination of President John Kennedy in 1963. The news appeared within 24 hours in almost every daily newspaper in the world. Because of radio and television, 99.8 percent of Americans knew of his assassination within five and one-half hours of the time the event occurred.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167745570801"><emphasis effect="bold">REVIEW | </emphasis>Early newspapers were far from objective. The ads they carried resembled today’s classified ads. Also, news traveled much more slowly then.</para>

      <section id="import-auto-id1167764237827">
        <title>Newspapers for the Common People</title>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167746230670">Until the early part of the nineteenth century, newspapers were quite expensive. A year's subscription cost as much as a skilled laborer could earn in a week. As a result, the bulk of the public did not buy or read papers. Because of the importance of newspapers for the development of a society such as ours, the country needed a cheap newspaper that the general public could afford—and we got it. This was the <emphasis effect="bold">penny press</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">newspapers that sold for just that—one penny an issue. These were the first newspapers in America </emphasis><emphasis effect="italics">published for the general public</emphasis>. The penny press was crucial to the growth of mass communication in America, for it brought virtually all economic classes into the ranks of newspaper readers. The development of the penny press was closely related to the larger Industrial Revolution, which transformed the entire social structure of much of the western world. </para><para id="import-auto-id1167743756836">The pioneer among these cheap newspapers was the New York <emphasis effect="italics">Morning Post</emphasis>, which came in with the new year on January 1, 1833. It lasted little longer than two weeks, even though the price per issue was slashed from two cents to one during its final few days. The printer associated with this historic venture was Horace Greeley, later to become one of the most famous newspaper editors in America. The first successful penny newspaper was <emphasis effect="italics">The New York Sun</emphasis>, started later that same year, and edited and published by another printer, Benjamin H. Day. The <emphasis effect="italics">Sun's</emphasis> lively style and emphasis on local stories captured the attention and the pennies of New Yorkers.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167749683758">Two aspects of the penny press were revolutionary for that day: the price, and the idea of selling newspapers by the individual copy rather than solely by subscription. It was far easier for working people to find a penny or two to pay for each single issue of a paper than to save enough pennies to pay for an entire year's subscription. Thus, for the first time, the working class was brought into the ranks of newspaper readers. The penny press also contributed to speeding up news coverage. </para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167743176812">These papers were highly competitive, and their competition was soon reflected in their trying to "scoop" each other. They used speedboats to try to beat each other to incoming ships in order to get the latest foreign news first, and they used horse expresses to get the news from Washington quickly. Even carrier pigeons were used to obtain news stories more quickly. The major advance in speed came with the telegraph, which newspapers began using in 1844. This revolutionary device was quickly adopted by most newspapers. By 1846, for example, all of the papers in New York had a column headed "By Magnetic Telegraph." </para>

        <title>The Development of Human Interest Stories</title>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167764289640">With the development of the penny Press came another, extremely important shift. This was the shift from newspapers that were highly partisan politically, often aided financially by the various political factions, to newspapers that were politically independent. In fact, after the Civil War the emphasis on political and governmental news declined. Newspapers broadened the scope of their news coverage. They also broadened their definitions of news to include the human interest story. </para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167772209297">One of the more exotic of these human interest stories was the expedition of a former war correspondent, Henry Stanley, into the heart of central Africa to find the lost missionary and explorer, David Livingstone. This expedition was sponsored by the New York Herald, which reported its every detail. (The Stanley and Livingstone story ultimately became a book and movie, as mentioned in Chapter 3.) </para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167779002875">The journalist who was perhaps most influential in setting the pattern of modern journalism was Joseph Pulitzer, publisher of the <emphasis effect="italics">St. Louis Post-Dispatch</emphasis> and, later, the <emphasis effect="italics">New York World</emphasis>. He developed many techniques for making his papers more interesting to the mass audience. These techniques proved so successful that they were soon being copied by other papers across the country. Pulitzer began the practice of having reporters continuously searching the city for incidents or situations that could be made interesting to readers, especially if presented in the paper as colorfully and sensationally as possible. He pioneered the newspaper crusade or stunt that could interest and hold the attention of readers, motivating them to buy every issue of the paper. The paper sponsored a drive to collect funds to build a pedestal for the Statue of Liberty, and readers were informed each day of the progress of the drive. Pulitzer also sent a female reporter, Nellie Bly, racing around the world by train, ship, and every other available means and held a contest to see which reader could come closest to guessing how long it would take. He was also the first publisher to use many newspaper illustrations. </para><para id="import-auto-id1167742459823">In striving to expand their readership, newspapers reported the news in short, snappy stories that were easy to read, and topped them with sensational headlines that caught the attention of potential buyers. As one author wrote, "News was not served raw. It was cooked, overdone, and heavily spiced." Such <emphasis effect="italics">excesses in news reporting around the turn of the century</emphasis> were called <emphasis effect="bold">yellow journalism</emphasis>, a term based on a popular comic strip called "The Yellow Kid." To some critics, the strip symbolized the sensationalism of much of the press during this period. </para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167764034374">Nowhere was competition more fierce and yellow journalism more prominent than in the pages of Joseph Pulitzer's <emphasis effect="italics">New York World</emphasis> and William Randolph Hearst's <emphasis effect="italics">New York Journal</emphasis>. Hearst, the son of a wealthy silver miner, had already adopted many of Pulitzer’s techniques at the <emphasis effect="italics">San Francisco Examiner</emphasis> before he entered the New York market. With the purchase of the <emphasis effect="italics">Journal</emphasis>, Hearst set out to compete head to head with Pulitzer. He hired away many of the <emphasis effect="italics">World's</emphasis> best journalists, established an evening edition to compete with Pulitzer's <emphasis effect="italics">Evening World</emphasis>, and added a comic supplement with more color than that of the Pulitzer newspaper. The war for talent resulted in both papers producing a version of "The Yellow Kid." At one point during the Spanish-American War—a war fought as much in the newsrooms as on the battlefields—circulations of the rival papers soared to more than a million copies a day. </para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167762661470">As you can see, many of the newspaper practices that we take for granted today, that we assume are simply "natural" parts of the news, developed out of the competition among journalists to catch the interest of potential readers and thus to sell more papers. Although we can and should criticize many of these practices, we must also recognize their benefits. They increase the prominence of newspapers in the communication environments of most of us and therefore increase the probability that we will encounter useful bits of information from newspapers we would not encounter otherwise.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167775273089"><emphasis effect="bold">REVIEW | </emphasis>The penny press, which was intended for the general public, revolutionized the newspaper business.

By the early part of this century, however, women had become an important political force, even though the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which assured them the right to vote, was not passed and ratified until 1920. In 1904, a newspaper for women was started, <emphasis effect="italics">The Daily Mirror</emphasis>, a forerunner of <emphasis effect="italics">Ms</emphasis>. With its pictorial journalism and illustrated commercial advertising, like the penny press, it captured and held the attention of people not accustomed to reading or, in many cases, not even able to read. </para></section>

        <para id="import-auto-id1167754178182">Most newspaper developments in America have been adopted or adapted from Europe, generally from England. A development that has gone the other way, a purely American phenomenon that has spread throughout the world, is the comic strip. Comics began in this country in the 1890s, when publishers started catering to the general public rather than the elite. They were first aimed at children, but it quickly became apparent that adults liked them also. The first national syndication of comic strips began in 1915, the comic book began in 1933, and the "serious" comic strip was inaugurated in 1941 with “Terry and the Pirates.” By the 1940s an estimated 27 million people were reading “Dick Tracy” every day. This was six or seven times as many as ever read the most popular novel of the period. </para>

Some of the stories come from the state bureau, some from the regional, and some from national and international; as a result, subscribing newspapers have a broad range of stories from which to select. They can also receive photographs and specialized news services, such as all sports, over special lines if they choose. </para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167745794524">Newspaper publishers originally developed wire services to save money and, at the same time, improve news coverage. In the 1840s, newspapers in New York became dissatisfied with the reports they were getting from the Mexican War battlefront and with the increasing rates they were being charged for telegraph lines used to transmit stories to the editorial offices. Six of them formed a cooperative to overcome the problem. One of their first ventures was using just one telegraph line, instead of six, to get foreign news from ships coming into Boston Harbor. As these cooperative ventures expanded, the group adopted a name, the New York Associated Press, and began selling news to papers in other cities. The Civil War greatly increased the demand for wire service news, as did the completion of a cable under the Atlantic Ocean in 1856, which brought greater and quicker access to news from Europe. </para><para id="import-auto-id1167746331256">Despite the attempts by the New York Associated Press to monopolize the wire service field, it was regularly challenged by other groups of newspapers. The original organization was finally driven out of business by the forerunner of what we know today as the Associated Press. </para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167753013657">The present-day United Press was formed by E. W. Scripps in 1907 and grew rapidly. In 1958 it merged with the International News Service to become United Press International. Unlike AB which is a nonprofit cooperative, UPI was supposed to be a profit-making enterprise. However, that has not been the case. After trying for decades to make the service profitable, Scripps sold UPI in 1982. In 1985 the wire service went into bankruptcy. It was purchased the next year by a Mexican publisher and sold again in 1988. Its next owners, Infotechnology Inc., had hoped to capitalize on the success of their other information service, the Financial News Network, which provides news and financial information to cable systems, personal computer users, and news organizations, but went bankrupt before the plans materialized. At present, a consortium of international news media is negotiating to become the newest owners of UPI. </para>

The Depression led to decreased income for newspapers because businesses could not afford to advertise as much; at the same time, labor union demands caused an increase in costs. Radio was a more serious threat, however, than either the Depression or the unions. The growth of radio-especially the growth of radio advertising and the broadcasting of news—was phenomenal. Sales of radio time had had reached $19 million a year by the time of the 1929 crash. Even worse, from the point of view of publishers, while newspaper advertising and television was declining in the early 1930s, radio advertising steadily rose. Thus, newspapers were hit by both the decreased Depression-era budgets of advertisers and the increased share of those budgets taken by radio.</para><para id="import-auto-id1167747385051">Newspapers were also much concerned about radio stations broadcasting the news. They were afraid people would stop buying newspapers if they could hear news free on radio. So they tried to prevent radio stations from using news from the wire services and other sources. When that tactic failed, many newspapers accepted the old dictum, "If you can't beat them, join them”: They began buying radio stations and starting new ones. As a result, by 1940 one-third of the radio stations in the United States were owned by newspapers.</para>

The city editor is responsible for local news, assigning reporters to stories and supervising copyreaders. The wire editor is the regional, national, and international counterpart of the city editor. Instead of selecting events to be covered by reporters, however, the wire editor selects stories from the wire services and assigns them to staff members who tailor them to the needs and available space in the paper.

The city editor decides to which local events or activities reporters should be assigned and to which reporter each assignment goes. Once the stories are brought in, the city editor decides which stories to use, how much of each to use, and how much prominence each should get. The city editor also affects the kind of story that gets written by the kind of reporter selected to do it. In covering the political campaign of a female candidate for a local office, for example/ one is likely to get quite a different story if the city editor sends the regular city hall reporter, a reporter who covers primarily news about the women's movement, or-to take a not-too-extreme case—a sports reporter.

Clearly, the owners and stockholders of the commercial media, including newspapers, are interested in maximizing profits, which means generally that they want large audiences in order to be able to charge high rates for advertising. However, in the vast majority of cases individuals in the operations end of a newspaper (or one of the other media) are also genuinely interested in serving the needs of audience members and of the larger society.

        <title>Distribution of Space in the Paper </title>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167742592509">The likelihood that you will encounter some particular bits of information in a newspaper about an event is affected, among other things, by the amount of space your newspaper devotes to that type of news. That, in turn, is partly—but not wholly—dependent on the judgments of the paper's editors. No editors have unlimited freedom in the decisions they make—far from it. First of all, most papers have a formula for determining the proportion of editorial space normally devoted to different sorts of material. (This "formula" is probably not printed anywhere and may not even be talked about, but it is there, clearly understood by all concerned.) One study found that the average newspaper divides its space as shown in Table 4.1. </para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167744609521">Keep in mind that these are average percentages. In a newspaper, <emphasis effect="italics">the space devoted to nonadvertising material</emphasis> is called the <emphasis effect="bold">news hole</emphasis>. That term covers not only what we normally think of as news, but comic ships, advice columns, editorials—everything other than advertising. The news hole is as low as 23 percent of the total column space in some papers and as high as 73 percent in others. The average is roughly 38 percent. </para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167745299747">You may think that the ratio of news to advertising material in a newspaper also varies with the amount of news there is to report. This is a sensible assumption—but a false one. Except when some extremely unusual occurrence happens, such as the assassination of a president, the advertising-to-nonadvertising ratio on most papers is kept relatively stable. As a result, the amount of news in the paper depends on the amount of advertising that has been sold, not on the number of important occurrences in the world; the more advertising, the larger the news hole. All of that space among the ads must be filled. So when you see a nice fat local newspaper every Wednesday afternoon or Thursday morning, it is not because Wednesdays are especially eventful; it is because Wednesday evening and Thursday morning are the times when all of the supermarkets advertise their weekend specials. </para><para id="import-auto-id1167751634805"><media id="space_allocation_newspapers" alt="A table that lists the percent of total column space taken up by various types of content: local news=4.5, foreign and national news = 7.5, leisure time feature = 5.0, People, entertainment, and opinion = 6.5, sports = 4.5, data and listings = 8.0, local retail advertising = 36, national advertising = 8.0, classified advertising = 20.0.">

Far less than 50 percent of time on any radio or television station is devoted to advertising. Yet broadcasting is criticized far more than newspapers for having too many ads. Why do you suppose that is?</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167772206224">Somewhat less than half of the newspapers in this country have a fixed minimum number of column inches they will devote to nonadvertising content; this minimum is generally a relatively low number, however, so on most days the space for news is still determined by the amount of advertising sold. Some newspapers use a sliding rather than a fixed percentage of their space for nonadvertising material. In those cases, although the amount of editorial matter increases with the amount of advertising sold, it increases at a slower rate so the more advertising sold, the smaller the percentage of nonadvertising matter. The amount of news most of us get in our local papers is thus more a function of the hustle of the advertising sales staff than the hustle of reporters. </para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167743888697">This system for determining the size of the news hole, coupled with the way in which the editorial staff must operate in order to get a paper out on time, results in an unwitting bias against late-breaking stories. Because the available space in a newspaper is fairly inflexible once the news hole has been determined by the advertising department, the nearer to press time a story breaks, the less its chance of getting into the paper. Early in the day, the editors are relatively free in their selection of stories to be written or rewritten, and prepared for layout because they must be certain there will be enough. As the day goes on and the editor is assured of having ample material, he or she becomes more selective, and stories are discarded that would have been selected if they had come in earlier. It is expensive to discard the already prepared stories in order to substitute other material. Thus, editors report they are as likely to hold a late-breaking story over to the next day as to replace a story that has already been prepared for the press. Virtually never is a paid ad pulled to make space for the story. In a very small percentage of cases, pages are added to handle the late news. </para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167742960972">Because it takes more time to process photographs than print, editors must make final decisions on them earlier in the day and so they have even less flexibility in adding photographic material during the last hour or two before press time. </para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167746776546">To compensate for the lag time between the breaking of a story and its appearance in the paper, all large newspapers and most small ones publish several editions.

A later edition begins rolling off the presses around 1:00 in the morning. Since the printing of the final edition lasts until about 4:15 P.M., there is still an opportunity to stop the presses and make last-minute changes if a story of major importance develops. A more common occurrence is changing the paper "on the fly." In this situation, the presses are stopped for maintenance purposes, allowing time for the inclusion of late bits of news—usually such things as ball scores from the West Coast. </para></section>

          <para id="import-auto-id1167748456610">Because advertising rates and the value of a newspaper’s stock depend largely on the number of copies sold per day, and advertisers want to be certain that the figure is reliable, this information is gathered fairly systematically by most papers. In fact, almost all daily newspaper circulation figures in this country are verified and reported in a standard way to ensure reliability and comparability. Such was not always the case. </para>
          <para id="import-auto-id1167745417889">Prior to the turn of the century, advertisers and others had to take a publisher's word for the number of copies sold, and that word was seldom reliable. This meant advertisers could never be certain which newspapers gave them the most readers for their money. Unhappy with this situation, a group of national advertisers formed the Association of American Advertisers in 1899 and hired a staff to verify the circulation claims of publishers. In 1914, this organization evolved into the <emphasis effect="bold">Audit Bureau of Circulations</emphasis> (ABC). </para>
          <para id="import-auto-id1167742623422">ABC today is the <emphasis effect="italics">organization that checks the circulation claims of newspapers and magazines and distributes these verified circulation data to publishers, advertisers, and advertising agencies</emphasis>. Because of the ABC, which continues to be an important element in American newspaper and magazine publishing, advertisers can now receive dependable circulation figures. The ABC has three major purposes, outlined in its by-laws: (1) to issue standardized statements of circulation data and other data reported by a member; (2) to verify the figures shown in those statements by auditors' examination of any and all records considered by the bureau to be necessary; and (3) to disseminate data for the benefit of advertisers, advertising agencies, and others interested in facts on the advertising and publishing industries. Advertisers and advertising agencies now routinely check to be certain that a newspaper or magazine's circulation claims have been verified by the ABC. </para><para id="import-auto-id1167748199740">Other kinds of information—the number and characteristics of the people who generally read each issue of the paper, what they read, and the interests of those who are presently readers—are generally gathered by independent market research firms hired by some newspapers. Although it seems a sound practice to understand one's readers and potential readers as fully as possible, some of this research is highly controversial among journalists. Many fear that newspaper owners and publishers will begin catering too much to the interests of the readers and that public desires as disclosed in this market research will displace the judgment of trained journalists in determining what goes into the newspaper. This is a difficult question. Undoubtedly, the results of market research can be abused. An editor can cater solely to the likes of readers and ignore their needs. On the other hand, it seems the more information about their public that reporters, editors, and publishers have, the more effectively they should be able to serve that public. Whether, in fact, the information from market research is used in this way depends on whether the newspaper personnel are concerned about maximizing their service to the public as well as maximizing profit. The two purposes are not necessarily incompatible. </para>

        <para id="import-auto-id1167748805306">Many people are concerned today about the seeming decline in the number of newspapers in this country. In fact, however, the number of daily papers has remained fairly constant since World War II, and the number of Sunday papers has actually increased, as has the total circulation of both daily and Sunday papers. The number of daily newspapers reached its peak in 1914, when almost twenty-five hundred of them were in operation in the United States. This number declined to about eighteen hundred in 1945 and is now about sixteen hundred twenty-five. Meanwhile, the number of Sunday papers has reached an all-time peak of 847. Newspaper circulation is also at an all-time high of over 62 million for dailies and Sunday papers. Table 4.2 shows the newspapers with the highest daily circulation. The two leaders, the <emphasis effect="italics">Wall Street Journal</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">USA Today</emphasis>, are considered national newspapers. </para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167754740749">One of the factors in the perception that newspapers are decreasing in number has been the well-publicized problems of a few, such as the <emphasis effect="italics">Chicago Daily News</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">Washington Star</emphasis>. However, most of the papers in financial trouble have been bought out, usually by a chain, and continue in operation. Afternoon papers have had the most difficult time in the past two decades, suffering more than a 30 percent drop in circulation; a few of them, in fact, were forced to close. During this same period, however, morning papers more than compensated for the afternoon circulation loss by increasing their circulation some 60 percent. </para>

As a larger and larger proportion of Americans turned from industrial employment to white collar and other service employment, more of us started going to work later and getting home later. So we have more time to read a morning paper after breakfast, but less time to read an evening paper before dinner. Television, too, seems to cut into reading time in the evening more than in the morning. Still another factor that contributed to the decline of afternoon papers was the physical change of cities. With gridlock traffic conditions in many urban areas, it became more and more difficult to deliver newspapers to customers. </para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167774241082">Changes in the number and ownership of newspapers reflect in large part the economic difficulties faced by the industry in the 1980s. The rising cost of newsprint, increased competition for advertising revenues, higher salary demands, and a host of other financial considerations forced newspaper owners to reevaluate their operations. One avenue available to them was made possible by the Newspaper Preservation Act passed by Congress in 1970. The act enables financially troubled newspapers in the same city to share costs by merging their noneditorial operations. Until this act was passed, a merger of this nature would have constituted a violation of the antitrust laws. The most highly publicized case involving such a merger took place in 1986 when the Gannett-owned Detroit News and Knight-Ridder's Detroit Free Press decided to combine operations. After a prolonged court battle in which citizens, employees, and advertisers fought the merger, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision allowing a joint operation agreement between the two papers. </para>

Like most kinds of papers, foreign language newspapers were most widespread in this country just before World War I. In 1914 there were about a thousand newspapers (and about three hundred magazines) published here in foreign languages. Most popular were the German language publications, which comprised about 40 percent of the total. These were also the papers hardest hit by the strong anti-German sentiment that swept the country during World War I. In 1914, New York alone had 32 foreign language dailies: 10 German, 5 Yiddish, 3 Italian, 2 Arabic, 2 Bohemian, 2 Greek, and one each of Chinese, Croatian, French, Hungarian, Russian, Serbian, Slovakian, and Slovenian. </para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167750071121">At one time or another in the history of this country, about three thousand newspapers have been started which were owned by blacks and directed primarily at a black audience. About two hundred of these exist today, most of them weeklies, but some monthlies and quarterlies. The first black newspaper, <emphasis effect="italics">Freedom's Journal</emphasis>, began publication in 1827. As the name suggests, its major purpose was to fight slavery in America. Other abolitionist papers followed, the most famous of which was Frederick Douglas' <emphasis effect="italics">North Star</emphasis>, introduced in 1847 and noted for its high literary quality. By the turn of the century, almost twelve hundred newspapers had been started by blacks, most of them devoted to civil rights issues ignored by the majority press. Although the average life span of a black newspaper has been nine years, one has lasted for more than a century. <emphasis effect="italics">The Philadelphia Tribune</emphasis>, begun in 1884, is the oldest continuously published black newspaper in America.

Currently there are about fifty major Spanish-language newspapers in this country, but that number is likely to increase. Demographers predict that by 2025, Hispanics will replace blacks as the nation's largest minority group. As this population has grown, English-language newspapers, have paid increasing attention to the needs of Hispanic readers. Some have created zoned editions, established bureaus in Hispanic communities, provided editorial supplements targeted to Hispanics, and offered bilingual Newspapers-in-Education programs. The Miami Herald has attempted to make its English language paper more attractive to Hispanics—especially to Cuban Americans who make up the largest ethnic group in South Florida—and at the same time upgrade its Spanish-language paper, El Nuevo Herald, which has a circulation of about one hundred thousand.</para>

        <para id="import-auto-id1167741419906">The development of cheap, offset printing methods for newspapers facilitated the development of the suburban weekly. After World War II, as offset printing was refined and as the suburbs proliferated and grew, the number of weeklies published specifically for the residents of these suburbs increased also. The suburban community is generally an upper middle class audience eager to subscribe to a newspaper and an audience with whom advertisers are eager to communicate because of its high disposable income. In addition, unlike the inner cities, where it is almost impossible to escape unionization, relatively few suburban papers are unionized. These factors, along with the more recent development of low-cost desktop publishing, combine to make the publication of a suburban newspaper a potentially profitable enterprise. About seventy-six hundred weekly newspapers are in operation in this country today. Well over six hundred semiweeklies and triweeklies are also being published. For journalists who want to be their own bosses and who want to create a newspaper in their own image, the small weekly, semiweekly, or triweekly may be their last opportunity. </para>

The early newsletters that were the forerunners of our present newspapers were designed to bring relevant news from around the world to business people and government leaders. Today's newsletters are more varied, but in almost every case they are designed to distribute information and ideas to a group of people who have a common interest but who are physically scattered. A large portion of those common interests are political. For example, we have the Common Cause newsletter, the newsletter of the John Birch Society, the United Nations Association newsletter, the National Retired Teachers Association newsletter, the newsletter of the American Civil Liberties Union, the Accuracy in Media newsletter, and hundreds of others. These newsletters serve many of the functions of conventional newspapers for individuals whose special interests cannot be satisfied by those general interest papers. </para>

        <para id="import-auto-id1167748792642">One trend in newspapers that is worrisome to some of us is the steadily increasing degree of standardization. The consolidation of newspapers into chains has contributed to this trend, but it is not the only factor. Many forces have pushed newspapers in this direction. One contributing factor has been the heavy dependence of almost all newspapers on the two major wire services, AP and UPI. An even more important factor has been the increasing use of syndicated materials such as political columns, comic strips, cartoons, crossword puzzles, specialized news, and on and on. Political analysts such as Jack Anderson, William F. Buckley, Jr., and David Broder are carried by hundreds of newspapers. Advice columnists Ann Landers and Judith Martin ("Miss Manners") are likely to be standard fare in "Features" sections of newspapers, and almost anywhere in the country you can follow "Beetle Baily" or "Garfield" or "Doonesbury."

        <para id="import-auto-id1167742376032">Between 55 and 65 percent of the average newspaper is devoted to advertising. This is critical for the owners and staff of a paper because the major part of their income comes from advertising, far more than from sales of the paper to readers. It is also important for readers. They pay less than half as much for each paper as they would need to pay if there were no advertising. Even more important, for a large percentage of readers the advertising matter itself serves an important function. It tells them what movies are available in town, when their favorite television programs are on, which supermarkets have the best bargains on what products, which stores are having sales, what bargains in used automobiles are available, and where one might find a ion. They can use the classified ads section themselves to sell their house or boat or to advertise for someone to fix the roof—or, in many papers, to find a lover. And those represent but a small sample of the valuable information and services made available through newspaper advertising. </para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167744650804">In addition to presenting news and advertising messages, the newspaper serves a great variety of other functions. It is a community bulletin board, informing readers of club meetings, marriages, births, and deaths, the budget of the school district, when our taxes must be paid, the deadline to register if we wish to vote, and where our polling place will be. It gives us a variety of help and advice, including ways to improve our bridge games, to spice up our dinner menus, and to grow bigger tomatoes. </para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167742539737">The newspaper is also a source of entertainment for most of us. Comic strips, for example, are devoted almost solely to our amusement. That these are important parts of most newspapers was emphasized some years ago when the popular "Doonesbury" comic strip was moved from the <emphasis effect="italics">Washington Post</emphasis> to the <emphasis effect="italics">Washington Star</emphasis>. During the transition, our nation's capital was without "Doonesbury" for three weeks, which created a crisis rivaled only by the energy crisis, inflation, and unemployment. Within two days of its dropping "Doonesbury," the Washington Post was flooded with over a thousand complaints and inquiries. Sales of out-of-town papers that carried the strip boomed in the Washington area. Radio stations read the blacked-out installments on the air and at least one television station showed the comic strip as part of its evening news program. The compilers of the official daily news summary for the president and other occupants of the White House printed the strips throughout the time they were unavailable in a Washington paper. And to still the clamor, the Star ran front-page blurbs promising to run all of the missing strips as soon as its rights to carry "Doonesbury" began. </para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167750196003">The entertainment function of the newspaper is not served only by its comic strips. Much of the material in the paper entertains in addition to its other functions. Columnists Art Buchwald and Mike Royko use satire to comment on political and social issues. Erma Bombeck uses humor to discuss the complications of family life. And the twists given to many major news stories help make them entertaining as well as informative—in fact, in many cases, the entertainment dominates. Almost any newspaper in the country would give greater play to a president's falling up the steps of his airplane than to the purpose of his trip. (Before condemning journalists for this practice, consider whether, given the choice, you would read a story first about the president's clumsiness or about the trip he is making.) </para></section>

        <title>Effects </title>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167745006817">Newspapers have played an important role in the history of this country and of the world. Together with books, they have made possible a great increase in the accumulation and distribution of knowledge. Printing literally produced the Enlightenment and was a major factor in the revolt against traditional leadership. Pamphlets and periodicals made it possible for revolutionary leaders in many countries to influence people far beyond the range of their voices. </para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167747036882">The master printers were an important force in the stabilization and standardization of our language. They became dictators of spelling conventions and guides to acceptable dialects and grammar. The master printer, unfortunately, is being made obsolete by the new methods of printing. Reporters and editors type their stories into computer terminals, and no further human processing is necessary until the paper reaches the reader. Since the spelling and grammar of today's reporters are no better than they were in the past, the loss of the master printer probably means that newspapers of the future will have less and less of a stabilizing and standardizing effect on our language. </para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167750757108">Newspapers were also a factor in the spread of literacy, for they motivated the working class in this country to learn to read. Most important, newspapers were the first of our mass media of communication to have a substantial impact on the democratization of knowledge, making relatively detailed information about our government, foreign countries, the economy, and other important matters equally available to all who could read. </para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167748362733">As knowledge was distributed, power inevitably followed. Thus newspapers contributed, and continue to contribute, not only to the democratization of knowledge but to our political democracy as well. </para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1167749287503"><emphasis effect="bold">REVIEW | </emphasis>Newspapers provide a variety of functions for readers. They are a source of entertainment as well as of news and other information. Newspapers have affected our political system, our language, and our reading ability and have brought about a democratization of knowledge. </para>

      <title>NEWSPAPERS IN OUR MOSAICS: A SUMMARY</title>
      <para id="import-auto-id1167743482273">Although the development of radio and television reduced somewhat the importance of newspapers in our communication mosaics, newspapers are still quite prominent there for most of us. They are especially important as sources of information about local events and local shopping. </para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1167745336905">The city editor and the wire editor have the greatest responsibility for determining which news stories you are given a chance to read in your local paper. The work of the advertising staff is also important because the more advertising they sell, the larger the news hole; that is, the more space there will be for news and other content. </para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1167744956370">We normally think of newspapers as publications dedicated primarily to "hard news," but you can go through a good part of most newspapers without encountering such news. World, national, and local news-including sports news—accounts for less than one-fifth of the space in most newspapers. Advertising, on the other hand, accounts for more than three-fifths. Entertainment, features, and editorials account for the remainder. </para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1167744341724">A variety of external forces influence the content of our newspapers. Press councils, where they exist, are concerned largely with the accuracy and fairness of news stories. Made up largely of respected citizens in a community, they inform both the newspapers and the public when a newspaper has flagrantly ignored one or both of these criteria. Audience research for newspapers consists mostly of gathering accurate data on the number and characteristics of readers. In some cases, information on audience needs and interests is also gathered as a guide to editorial decisions. Other influences, covered in greater detail in Chapters 12,13, and 14, are the laws regarding freedom of the press, libel, and the right to a fair trial; pressure groups of all sorts; the traditional norms of journalism; and, most important of all, advertising and other economic forces. </para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1167751738089">You are not as likely to have more than one local daily newspaper to read as your great-grandparents did in the early part of this century. Despite continued growth in population, the number of daily newspapers is less today than it was just before World War I. On the other hand, circulation is at its highest level—but not for all newspapers. While circulation of morning papers continues to rise, there has been a steady drop in afternoon paper circulation, reflecting the changing work habits and lifestyles of Americans, competition from television, and the difficulty of delivering newspapers in congested urban areas during the day. Minority and foreign-language papers continue to dot the newspaper landscape. Spanish-language papers in particular are likely to grow in number as the Hispanic population increases. </para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1167743087962">The number of suburban newspapers and newsletters has also increased greatly in recent years—in large part because of low-cost offset printing methods and the even less expensive desk-top publishing technology. </para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1167742540414">In short, although a great deal of concern is expressed these days about the fact that many people seldom read newspapers, the fault does not lie in the availability of the papers. A more justifiable concern, but one we do not hear as often, is the increasing control of newspapers by a handful of giant corporations or chains. This concentration of ownership could result in fewer news sources and points of view and a greater emphasis on profits than performance. Another concern is the trend toward standardization. Newspapers have always relied on the same wire services, AP and UPI, for much of their news. But now they are just as likely to rely on the same syndicates and specialized news services for their political columnists, cartoons, comic strips, and features, and to imitate the format of a single success story—<emphasis effect="italics">USA Today</emphasis>. </para>
