The media rarely act without considering this goal. Most careful observers blame this drive to build ever more salable audiences on the decline in the amount and quality of serious and important news in the major media. Because most of the media are so inextricably bound to advertising and public relations in this country, directly or indirectly, we must understand those two industries, and the other economic influences, if we want to understand why we get the kinds of media and media content that we do.</para>

      <title>VARIETIES OF ECONOMIC CONTROLS</title>
      <para id="import-auto-idm398228064">Some media critics take the position that advertising and other economic factors are not merely part of the reason we get the kinds of media and media content we do; they claim the economic system is the dominant reason. At its most extreme, this argument has been labeled <emphasis effect="bold">economic determinism</emphasis>. This is the <emphasis effect="italics">theory that the economic system of a country is the dominant influence on almost everything, including all of the content of the mass media</emphasis>. Those who believe in economic determinism argue that the individuals and organizations that control most of this country's economic resources, and are always striving to control more, are ultimately the most powerful—and perhaps the only—influences on our communication environment that make any difference.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm368778544">Economic determinists say, for example, that a new medium of com­munication develops in our society only when there is a reasonable probability that it will be profitable, and that the particular way it is developed is the way that will be the most profitable. Thus, they say, newspapers are organized as they are because that form has been found to be most profitable. The same is true for radio, television, motion pictures, the record industry, book publishing, and so on. These critics predict that satellite-to-­home communication will not become widespread unless and until a way is found to make it more profitable than present cable or network television. </para><para id="import-auto-idm785359360">Although most of us would argue that factors other than economics affect our communication environment, we suspect all of us would agree that economics are important. In the United States, as in many countries, the majority of our media institutions are businesses, dependent on the sale of advertising, the sale of the information/entertainment product (the newspaper, magazine, book, recording; or home video), or the sale of admission tickets (to movie houses or for pay television). Almost anyone in the media who ignores the economic factors is soon out of a job, or else the organization is out of business. Even those in the noncommercial media—public broadcasting, university presses, educational film or video production units in schools or colleges—cannot totally ignore economics.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm787109552"><emphasis effect="bold">REVIEW |</emphasis> Although economic determinists probably assume too much influence on the media from the pressures to sell more advertising, tickets, or subscriptions, or from the related drive to maximize profits, those pressures are real. Economic factors clearly play an important role in determining what we can see, read, and hear in the media and in the kinds of media we have.</para>
      <section id="import-auto-idm715068704">
        <title>Advertising Controls </title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1042007280">The influence of advertising is most obvious in newspapers. There, with few exceptions, the number of pages printed—and, hence, the amount of space available for news—is determined not by the amount of news deemed important, but rather by the amount of advertising sold. (This was discussed more fully in Chapter 4.)</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm406244768">The newspaper is not the only medium affected by advertising, however. Although the length of newscasts on broadcasting stations does not vary daily because of variations in the amount of advertising, the number of newscasts is affected by the availability of sponsorship. More important, other kinds of programming—including documentaries and the discussion of contemporary issues—are strongly affected by economic questions. Not only does availability of sponsorship increase the probability that a program will be aired, but it also increases the probability that it will be aired at a time when there is a large available audience. Even with spon­sorship, however, managers of radio and television stations hesitate to place into prime time a program that will not draw a large audience because it will not deliver enough viewers or listeners to the commercial programs that ·follow it. Similarly, live coverage of special events, such as a congressional hearing, will not be presented often because of the great loss of income from regularly scheduled programs and commercials. None of these commercial media can stay alive unless they can attract and hold sufficient advertising to pay all expenses of both the commercial and non­ commercial programs and pay a reasonable return on the investment of owners or stockholders. (What constitutes a "reasonable return" and the basis on which it should be calculated are questions no data can answer. An individual or group of individuals must define "reasonable." However, your answers to those questions are critical for your decisions about whether the media could better serve the public interest.)</para>

          </media>
        </figure><para id="import-auto-idm347990400">Advertising affects the content of the media in many ways. One of the most important, as we noted before, is that advertisers want to buy particular kinds of audiences. Consequently, programmers and editors, writers and directors, attempt to create and transmit the sorts of materials that will attract those audiences. NBC increased its profitability tremendously in recent years, for example, with shows such as "Cheers," "The Golden Girls," and "The Cosby Show," which appealed to young, urban audiences—the upwardly mobile, high-consumption audiences that advertisers love. Sports coverage is tremendously important for newspapers, radio, and television because the audience it attracts is not only large but also predominantly male, and therefore easily salable to the advertisers of products whose major purchasers are males.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm685581376">These kinds of content not only attract the "right" sorts of audiences, but they also provide good contexts for advertising. Companies do not want their commercials or advertisements accompanying a story that will depress the audience and distract them from wanting to buy; they want a context that will put consumers in the right mood—a buying mood. Ideally, the context should help produce a feeling of need. This is the reason special sections of newspapers have developed: travel sections in which ads for airlines and travel agents are buried amidst features on exotic places; fashion sections with features that tell us what we should be wearing this season—and ads that tell us where to buy those fashions; entertainment sections that place glowing reviews of movies and night club acts right next to the ads that tell us where those shows are playing.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm353065760"><emphasis effect="bold">BYLINE |</emphasis> How many examples of this kind of newspaper content can you find in your Sunday newspaper? These might be stories or features that create the “right” context for a particular kind of advertising or that attract advertisers in other ways.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm404850320">The media are not simply distribution systems for advertising, at least not in the minds of advertisers. Advertisers judge each medium in terms of its relative effectiveness as an agent of persuasion. Credibility is one factor in that effectiveness. This is one of the reasons why high-quality news coverage is important for newspapers and television. The credibility gained from carrying news that people want and trust probably generalizes to some extent to the entire paper, station, or network, thus making its advertising more credible.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm403124832"><emphasis effect="bold">REVIEW |</emphasis> The drive to attract and hold advertisers affects the amount and kinds of news available in each of the media.</para>

      <section id="import-auto-idm1199687296">
        <title>Public Relations</title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm718701552">Although few critics blame the public relations industry as much as the advertising industry for the content of the media, it is far more influential than most people realize. Many of the "news" stories we read and see in the mass media originate from press releases written to promote someone or something. Many news stories in the entertainment sections of our newspapers are news releases from motion picture distributors about the stars of a new movie, its plot, writer, director, or anything else that will interest potential theater goers in the film. Many talk show guests are placed there by public relations firms to plug a book, movie, or a major sports event such as the Super Bowl. Much of the "news" we get from Washington and the state capitols originated with the public relations specialists in various government agencies.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm714640944">Even the plots of some movies and television programs were developed in consultation with public relations agents whose clients want the general audience exposed to those particular ideas.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm367809504"><emphasis effect="bold">REVIEW |</emphasis> Public relations is the unseen hand that shapes a large amount of the "news" and entertainment that we encounter in our communication environment.</para>
      </section>
      <section id="import-auto-idm388309824">
        <title>Ownership Controls </title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm346142528">Perhaps the least obvious of all economic controls is ownership. In the days of local ownership, one seldom found negative news in the newspaper or newscasts about the owner's other business interests, family, or friends. This was a fairly trivial problem. But as newspapers, motion picture studios, broadcasting stations and networks, and book publishing firms have been taken over by giant corporations with a great variety of interests, many of them stretching across the globe, ownership controls may be a more critical problem. We must ask whether newspapers or magazines owned by a corporation with heavy financial interest in the power industry are likely to publish exposes of the dangers of nuclear power plants. We must also wonder whether a broadcasting network that belongs to a conglomerate with profitable contracts to supply electronic equipment to Saudi Arabia or Brazil will feel as free to pursue and expose government wrongdoings in those countries as a network without such interests. If all of this sounds farfetched, you must not have heard about the incident at NBC's "Today" show when they were broadcasting a report about the use of shoddy nuts and bolts in airplane engines. One of the major suppliers of those dangerous nuts and bolts was General Electric, the corporation that owns NBC. Viewers of the "Today" show, however, never learned of General Electric's involvement because the network news division edited out all mention of the company before the story was broadcast.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm798922800">We are not suggesting here that the heads of such corporations as General Electric regularly apply pressure on their communication subsidiaries to cover the news in a particular way. Rather, knowing the interests of the company that pays one's salary can result in a type of self-censorship by individuals in the media.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm404228432"><emphasis effect="bold">REVIEW |</emphasis> When those who own any of the news media also have other business interests, another hurdle is placed in the path of journalistic objectivity.</para>
        <section id="import-auto-idm792881344">
          <title>Ticket sales and sales of the "product." </title>
          <para id="import-auto-idm795396928">Motion pictures and legitimate drama are also affected by economics. Hollywood and Broadway have often been condemned because · of the power of "business people" or "bankers"; however, it seems logical that anyone considering financing a play or motion picture would want to do so only if enough tickets could be sold to recover the original investment plus a reasonable profit. Potential backers for motion pictures, legitimate dramas, and television series also consider the salability of the product in secondary markets—for sale or rental through another medium, for distribution in other countries, and (in the case of television series) for reruns on the network or individual stations. Even the publication of books is affected in this way. A novel with the potential for adaptation to the screen has a better chance of being selected by a publisher than one without this potential. Obviously, all of these factors affect the kinds of products that are financed by or for the media, and hence, the kinds of products that become available in our communication environment.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm1038816704">An interesting sort of by-product often important for a company's profitability is one that capitalizes on a character, idea, or person made famous through a motion picture, television series, record, or book. Walt Disney Productions makes more money today from Mickey Mouse toys, shirts, and so on, and from Disney World and Disneyland, which are based on characters and scenes from Walt Disney films, than it does from the films themselves. Even noncommercial television has earned in­ come to support programs through its royalties on toys and clothing featuring characters from "Sesame Street." You may have unwittingly contributed to the support of "noncommercial" television by buying such products.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm347474992"><emphasis effect="bold">REVIEW |</emphasis> The content of our media is strongly influenced by the drive to sell more books, papers, and tickets, to export movies and television series overseas, o auction movie and television rights to books, and to merchandise characters popularized in the media—e.g., selling dolls, T-shirts, and other products based on them.</para>

      <title>ADVERTISING </title>
      <para id="import-auto-idm851155392">We have discussed advertising at various points throughout this book because of its importance to all media. Advertisements are the major source of income for the media and, hence, are a large part of the content of many of them. In addition, all of the media we considered must advertise themselves in order to attract audiences. It is almost impossible to sell books, magazines, recordings, or newspapers, or to get audiences for a motion picture or a radio or television program, without advertising.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm1013604816">Throughout this book, we have stressed the way bits of information we receive from our communication mosaics affect the worlds we construct in our heads. In thinking about that, do not overlook the fact that advertising—print ads, radio and television commercials, billboards, and advertising's many other forms—contributes many of those bits. Advertisements make up a large part of our communication mosaics.</para>
      <section id="import-auto-idm396089392">
        <title>Origins and Development of Advertising </title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm405376640">Some form of advertising has existed ever since the first would-be trader proclaimed the merits of some possession to all within hearing distance. Many town criers were, in effect, professional proclaimers, hired to wander through a village or along the countryside loudly extolling the virtues of particular shops.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm396071392">The earliest surviving piece of advertising is a clay tablet produced about 3000 B.C. in Babylonia. On it are inscribed notices about an ointment dealer, a scribe, and a shoemaker.<sup>1</sup> Another early form of advertising was the sign placed over a shop or market stall. Such signs led to government regulation of advertising—the first that we know about. A law was passed in England in 1614 restricting signs from extending more than eight feet from a building and requiring them to be sufficiently high off the ground to permit an armored man on horseback to pass underneath.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm802025584">Like mass communication generally, advertising received a major boost with the development of the printing press. Printing made possible mass production and distribution of advertisements, initially in the form of handbills. As printing presses became more widespread in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the use of handbills and posters for advertising spread with them.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm374359872">The practice of newspaper advertising began during the seventeenth century in England, and at about the turn of the century in the American colonies. America also followed the mother country in the development of advertising agencies. Agencies were operating in England in 1800, while the first one in this country was organized about 1840. The primary business of this American agency, started by Volney B. Palmer, was to buy space from newspaper and magazine publishers at a special rate and resell it to advertisers at a higher rate. This type of brokerage business was the primary function of advertising agencies for many years.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm405276032">At the end of the nineteenth century, when substantial growth in selling space was no longer possible and new sources of revenue were being sought, agencies began providing such additional services as writing advertising copy, selecting media for advertisers, and conducting market research.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1015884416">The early twentieth century saw two important developments in the advertising industry: a struggle to reduce or eliminate unethical advertising practices and the application of social scientific research methods to increase the effectiveness of advertising. In 1911, <emphasis effect="italics">Printer's Ink</emphasis>, a major trade publication for newspaper and magazine publishers, advocated that fraudulent and misleading advertising be made illegal. Such legislation was also pushed by the Better Business Bureau. This is <emphasis effect="italics">an organization of business people that attempts to eliminate business practices that hurt the image of business—such as practices that are unfair to consumers.</emphasis> Finally, in 1914, Congress passed the <emphasis effect="bold">Federal Trade Commission Act</emphasis> that <emphasis effect="italics">outlawed unfair methods of doing business</emphasis>. The Act established the <emphasis effect="bold">Federal Trade Commission (FTC)</emphasis> as <emphasis effect="italics">the agency charged with developing and enforcing rules to eliminate those unfair business practices</emphasis>. As we will explain later in this chapter, the FTC today is the primary government agency that controls false and misleading advertising.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm395670048"><emphasis effect="bold">REVIEW |</emphasis> Advertising existed at least five thousand years ago, but its modern form started with the printing press. Serious efforts to control misleading advertising, however, did not begin until early in this century.</para>

        <title>How Advertising Gets into Our Mosaics </title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm745652304">Advertising gets into our communication environments in a wide variety of ways because of the many different types of advertising and organizations responsible for its appearance. A simple form of advertising is the "For Sale" sign in the window of your automobile, or a call to your local radio station's "trading post" program to announce what you want to buy, sell, or trade. Somewhat more involved is a want ad in your local newspaper. Among the most complex forms of advertising is the large and expensive professional campaign to launch a new product into the national market using a variety of media.</para>
        <section id="import-auto-idm352704304">
          <title>Components of the advertising industry. </title>
          <para id="import-auto-idm372054352">To understand some of the major ways advertising comes into being and is distributed, you need to be familiar with the large variety of types of organizations and individuals involved. You know something about advertising agencies already, but you may not know that almost every large store, manufacturer, and other kind of business that must attract customers (including book and magazine publishing firms, motion picture companies, and others) has an advertising department. For small businesses that cannot afford an advertising department, planning and supervision of advertising is a large part of the job of one or more executives. In addition, every broadcasting station, newspaper, and magazine has an advertising department that works with individuals, companies, and advertising agencies interested in advertising in that medium.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm797156048"><emphasis effect="bold">REVIEW |</emphasis> There are a great variety of types of organizations working to help companies persuade you to buy something. There are advertising departments in businesses and in the media, advertising agencies, production companies, and research firms, to name a few.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm390047472">Advertising agencies vary tremendously in size and complexity. Some do little more than advise clients regarding the kinds of advertising appeals to use and the media in which to use them, and then how to buy time and space for that advertising. Others have research departments to study systematically the kinds of people most likely to purchase a company's product, the kind of advertising most likely to appeal to such potential customers, and the media that can most likely reach the potential purchasers. They also have creative departments with every sort of media artist who can turn those ideas into advertisements and commercials, media departments that know where and how to get the best media buys, and every other sort of expert needed to inform the public about a product and to persuade as large a portion of that public as possible to spend money for that product.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm766075168">There are also specialized firms that assist advertising agencies or advertisers in planning, creating, distributing, or evaluating their advertising. There are market research organizations, commercial art firms, motion picture and video organizations specializing in the production of commercials, and firms specializing in selling advertising space and time for local newspapers and broadcasting stations to national advertisers. These are but a sample of the firms involved in some aspect of the advertising business.</para>

          <title>Types of advertising appeals. </title>
          <para id="import-auto-idm346631312">The answers to these and other questions provide the basis for developing an advertising strategy. A key part of that strategy is determining what persuasive appeal or appeals to build the campaign upon. To be effective, the appeal must be meaningful, believable, and distinctive. Appeals can point out a product's unusual quality, its style, cost, comfort, dependability, safety, convenience, or the status it provides its owner.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm405186448">Many kinds of appeals and strategies are used in advertising. Essentially, they can be divided into three types: (1) the <emphasis effect="bold">direct approach</emphasis>, which <emphasis effect="italics">emphasizes information about the product</emphasis>, (2) the <emphasis effect="bold">indirect approach</emphasis>, which <emphasis effect="italics">attempts to associate the product with something potential purchasers believe to be attractive</emphasis>, and (3) the <emphasis effect="bold">saliency approach</emphasis>, which simply <emphasis effect="italics">tries to make people remember the name or brand</emphasis>. The direct and the indirect approaches are designed to shape the attitudes of consumers, making them more likely to purchase the product. The saliency approach attempts no attitude change; it simply tries to increase the likelihood that when you consider buying a product you will think of this particular brand or will recognize it in a store.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm371623200">Much of the criticism of advertising is directed at the indirect approach. The associations developed with the product tell us nothing about the nature or quality of the product. Examples of such advertisements are those that show a lovely model lounging in or on an automobile, an aging actor discussing a particular investment firm, or young couples having a wonderful time on the beach while consuming a particular soft drink. The assumption is that we will associate the product with people we consider beautiful or intelligent or with a situation we find appealing and so will feel more favorable toward the product.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm366462112">The saliency approach assumes that the purchasing of some products has little to do with beliefs about the quality or other attributes of the product. Consumers either perceive little difference among different brands of these products or perceive that the choice is not important enough to bother considering quality factors. We buy the brand whose name we happen to think of when we need that product or whose label we recognize when we walk down the aisle in the store.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm787037296"><emphasis effect="bold">BYLINE |</emphasis> Find a sample of advertisements that take the direct route to persuasion, a sample that take the indirect route, and a sample that take the saliency route. Analyze them to see whether you can explain why the advertisers in each group chose that route over the others.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm339352912">None of these advertising approaches is right or wrong. Each results from the recognition that different factors are important when we buy different products. In fact, sometimes different factors are important to different people even when they are buying the same product. For example, the cost of an automobile is an extremely important factor for most people. For others, however, the status they associate with certain kinds of cars is even more important.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm711452160"><emphasis effect="bold">REVIEW |</emphasis> The optimum advertising campaign depends on the kind of product or service, the kind of customer likely to buy it, the form of distribution, the competition, the sales goal, and the advertising budget available.

If it is in a print medium, the layout, use of graphics or photos, color, size of type, and size of ad can affect attention. In television commercials, sound effects, color, composition, editing, and performers are among the many relevant factors. Music, other sound effects, and vocal qualities can make a difference in radio. In all cases, the contrast of the advertisement with adjacent material affects attention. Strong contrast with adjacent advertisements is generally desirable in print media. In radio and television, a minimum of contrast with the regular program is sometimes desirable so the audience does not put its defenses up when program material switches to advertising.</para>

The selection of media has many aspects. First is whether to use one medium or some combination of media. Then, for each medium used, decisions must be made about where to place the ads. For example, should they be in the sports section or during a sports broadcast, or are they more likely to be noticed by the right people in the regular news sections of the newspaper or during a break in a newscast? Or are we more likely to catch the attention of the right audience by placing our ads just after a situation comedy or in the middle of a humorous short story in a magazine? Should we place them on billboards along major highways or on the strips leading into small towns? </para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm785578432">Another aspect of media selection is deciding on the pattern of exposure. Should we run our ads infrequently over a long period of time, or frequently over a short period of time, or in an irregular pattern? Should our ads consistently be in the same part of the newspaper, magazine, or broadcast, or should they constantly be shifted around? Each of these decisions will affect the kinds of people exposed, the conditions under which they are exposed, and the patterns of repetition with which they are exposed.</para>

They conduct different kinds of research at each planning stage of an advertising campaign. They study consumer motivation to determine the potential customers for a product and the needs or wants consumers have that the product might serve. Researchers study the habits of these customers to determine through what media they can be reached and through what outlets the product is best distributed. They pretest advertisements or appeals to see whether they are likely to work with the target audience. Some test <emphasis effect="bold">visual efficiency</emphasis> to discover how an advertisement competes against others for readers' or viewers' attention and how long people must attend to it before they remember it. <emphasis effect="italics">The more attention an ad gets and the shorter attention span required for people to remember it, the greater an advertisement's visual efficiency</emphasis>. A few firms measure the impact of an advertisement on heart rate, dilation of the pupil of the eye, or the degree to which a person's skin conducts electricity. All of these physiological responses are associated with degree of attention and emotional arousal. The presumption is that advertisements that attract a high level of attention or a high level of emotional arousal are more likely to be effective than those that do not.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm701724736">During or after an advertising campaign, researchers study its success in order to determine what should be changed on this or future campaigns. An obvious method of assessment is examining what happens to sales of the product. Other methods include testing attitudes toward the commercial and the product, assessing recall of the advertisement, and testing association of the product with a slogan or other content of the advertising. Some firms also estimate the number of persons exposed to an advertisement or an advertising campaign. From this information, they can calculate cost per thousand—the cost divided by the number of thousands of people an advertisement reaches. Thus, if an advertisement that costs $150 reaches 20,000 people, the cost per thousand is $150 divided by 20, or $7.50.</para>

Much of this regulation came as a reaction to the wild and extravagant claims of some patent medicine advertisers during the latter part of the nineteenth century and early in this century. These wild claims seemed even worse than they were because of their number; patent medicines were the most heavily advertised group of products in this country in the 1870s.

This is important to do if we want to understand mass communication. However, we should not forget that the primary purpose of advertising and public relations is to affect people. Advertising and public relations are designed to influence our beliefs or behaviors—to get us to buy a product, vote for a candidate, watch a particular program, contribute money to a particular cause, or simply be more favorably disposed toward an idea, person, or organization.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1044142512">Nor should we overlook the fact that most people find advertising useful. It saves us search time when we want to know what movies are playing in town, where they are playing, and when.

      <title>PUBLIC RELATIONS </title>
      <para id="import-auto-idm352461056">Throughout this book we discussed the fact that the world in your head is largely your own creation, a product of the many bits of information to which you have been exposed, the order and contexts of that exposure, and your personal needs and attitudes. The job of public relations practitioners is to affect those parts of the world in your head that are relevant to their clients. For example, if their client is IBM, they want that image of IBM in your head to be one of a public-spirited organization that is working to help you. If their client is the Red Cross, they want you to perceive that organization as being on the spot helping people anywhere in the world where trouble strikes; they also want you to know that their continued good work depends on your generosity. If the client is a movie or television performer, the public relations agency wants to increase that performer's popularity with the public and to convince producers and di­ rectors to cast him or her in more shows.</para>

In fact, such communication is often unavoidable. If an individual or organization is involved with the public in any way, it is involved in public relations. The only question is the sophistication and professional help it will choose to bring to the task.

It includes, among other things, all varieties of communication designed to raise funds, to make someone or something better known, to build public support for or against a piece of legislation, or otherwise to affect public opinion about a person, organization, product, or idea. <emphasis effect="bold">Public relations</emphasis> at its best is <emphasis effect="italics">the identification, establishment, and maintenance of mutually beneficial relationships between an organization and the various publics on which its success or failure depends.</emphasis><emphasis effect="italics"/><sup>3</sup></para><para id="import-auto-idm364532992">It is not always clear when the activities of someone ought to be viewed as public relations, when they ought to be viewed as advertising, and when they ought to be viewed simply as carrying out one's job with no regard for public opinion. When individuals or institutions have any relationship with the public, everything they do that is visible, or whose effect is visible, affects relations with that public. For example, if you run a business in your home town, you must operate in some sort of building. Whether you intend it or not, the appearance of that building affects the public's opinion of your business, as does the sign outside, the advertising that you do, the quality of the products or services you provide, your statements reported in the media, other news stories about you and your business that appear in the media, and so on. Each of these has a public relations component. In short, you cannot avoid public relations.

Early public relations efforts in the American colonies involved such diverse ventures as Sir Walter Raleigh's unsuccessful attempt in 1584 to persuade English citizens to emigrate to Roanoke Island (off the coast of North Carolina) and Harvard College's drive to raise funds in the 1640s. The earliest known press release in this country was one sent to all newspapers in New York City in 1758 announcing the first commencement at King's College (now Columbia University). </para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm404812064">The efforts of the Americans to gain their freedom from England brought public relations efforts to a peak, both in number and ingenuity. The Boston Tea Party, for example, was staged to dramatize British tyranny and crystallize American public opinion. The dumping of British tea in Boston's harbor by revolutionaries dressed as Indians was accompanied by systematic efforts to spread the story throughout the colonies and, through letters and leaflets, to appeal for support of the American cause. </para>

Skilled practitioners of the art took ordinary pioneers who had done something notable and built them into myths. The myth of Daniel Boone, for example, was created by a landowner trying to persuade people to settle in Kentucky. The legend of Davy Crockett was constructed in an attempt to win the frontier vote away from presidential candidate Andrew Jackson.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm785494224">The factor most responsible for making public relations a major industry was the strong antibusiness attitudes aroused by questionable business practices in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The exploitation of people and resources in this country by the giant industrialists created bitterness and strife. The sort of muckraking journalism discussed in Chapter 4 made the public angry about corruption not only in business but in politics as well. Public demand for government regulation and other reforms swelled. Finally, industry, business, and government leaders realized that public opinion could no longer be ignored, so they turned to public relations experts to improve the public's opinion of them. By the turn of the century, public relations was generally accepted as a major arm of any large business or industry.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1071619824">The potential of public relations for government agencies was effectively demonstrated during World War I by the Committee on Public Information, headed by George Creel. Through motion pictures, newspaper stories, posters, and public speeches, Creel and his staff built and sustained strong public support for America's war effort. The Office of War Information in World War II continued and expanded the practices Creel pioneered. The agency won public acceptance of rationing and other sacrifices, promoted the sale of war bonds, and maintained strong public morale. The success of the Committee on Public Information and the Office of War Information spurred the development of public relations departments in virtually every agency of government.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm745401648">Since the early days of this profession, public relations has become increasingly sophisticated, relying on opinion research and other methods of assessing the beliefs and attitudes of relevant publics.

In addition, countless companies, institutions, organizations, and government agencies—even many that employ outside agencies—have public relations departments or personnel. Every government agency in Washington, with the possible exception of the Supreme Court, has a staff of public relations experts whose job is to build goodwill with the public and, even more, with legislators and the administration so that they will continue to support funding for the agency. Our armed forces, for example, have probably the largest battery of public relations personnel in the world. The public relations arm of the Department of Defense became so large and began putting so much pressure on the Congress in the 1970s that it became the subject of a highly controversial television documentary, "The Selling of the Pentagon." The program provided much insight into the public relations operations of government agencies. Probably every senator and representative in Washington also has someone in charge of public relations.

These are only a few of the ways public relations experts shape our communication environment.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm369623072">Sometimes public relations involves concealing rather than revealing information, although public relations experts disagree on the wisdom of this practice. Consider, for example, the State Department press officer answering questions about some delicate negotiations with another country or about a clandestine operation. Or consider the school board that has ordered the removal of certain books from the school library but does not want to arouse a public outcry. Imagine a college information officer explaining why the college did not expel students who damaged administration offices when protesting cuts in financial aid or increases in tuition. Or think of the public relations representative for a coal mining firm who is asked to explain the deaths of miners in a pit that the company knew was dangerous. Skillful public relations efforts are required in each of these cases, especially since the wisest approach, both for the organization involved and for the public, is not usually obvious.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm388529968">A difficulty in many of these cases is that any organization has different publics with whom it must communicate: clients/consumers, employees, stockholders, the community, various levels of government, suppliers, distributors, and the media—to name the most obvious groups. Often, those publics have very different values and interests. Think, for example, of the college that does not want to expel student protesters, even though they did extensive damage to college property. The institution's public relations representative must explain the decision in a way acceptable to students, who hold a wide range of individual opinions on the subject, to faculty, to parents, to townspeople, to trustees, to state officials (if it is a public institution), and to other people on whom the college depends for financial stability. No explanation will satisfy all of these publics.</para>

In some cases, separate subdepartments handle community relations, employee relations, and general public relations.

Ascertaining the opinions of the public toward the client, product, or idea being promoted is the key research function for most public relations firms. Before you can do an effective public relations job for the Red Cross or the Pentagon, for example, you must know not only the opinion or image you want to create but also what the present public opinion or image is. You also need to discover whether segments of the public differ in their opinions, what types of in­ formation are likely to change the opinions of each segment, and which media can reach these various segments. Research also must be done regularly to determine whether a public relations campaign is working. In short, a good public relations agency or department constantly assesses public opinion to determine whether different types of public relations efforts are needed.</para>

We noted some of these forms earlier in the chapter, but there are many others. The much-heralded annual awards for outstanding motion pictures or television programs, books or recordings, journalistic achievements, and so on, are highly successful public relations for those industries. There is probably no more successful public relations gimmick in the world than the motion picture industry's annual Oscar awards—preceded by weeks of hype, produced as a television extravaganza, and followed with a newspaper, magazine, and television advertising campaign that capitalizes on the awards to sell more tickets for the films that were recognized.</para>

The letter you receive from a store or manufacturer after you complain about poor merchandise is part of a public relations effort. Television programs in which the station manager and program director answer viewers' questions about the station are part of an effort to improve relations with the public. Even the physical design of stores and industries and the packaging of products are planned in part to shape the public image of that product or institution. In a sense, every time you are exposed to information about individuals or institutions that depend in some way on the public and that had some hand in shaping that information, you are exposed to public relations.</para>

At times, the function is to improve image or to generate goodwill. Sometimes the function is to increase sales, expand membership, or, in the case of charities or political candidates, to increase contributions of money or time. Public relations with the members of one's organization or institution are designed to increase morale, build loyalty, and improve job performance. Sometimes the purpose of public relations efforts is to encourage or discourage some government action, either directly, by influencing the views of government officials, or indirectly, by creating pressure from the general public.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm764383136">Public relations campaigns are begun every day. Broadcasters who want less government regulation of their industry have mounted a public relations campaign to convince both public and relevant government officials of the wisdom of deregulation. The president is constantly building support for his policies through every mode and medium of communication. The American Tobacco Institute is presently faced with one of the most difficult public relations jobs of all: trying to convince the public and members of Congress that the contributions of the tobacco industry to the American economy are greater than the dangers smoking poses to the health of citizens. Industries fighting pollution-control legislation face a similar task. Not much easier is the public relations task of those who are trying to convince motorists not to drive when they drink.</para>

And it certainly is not a mass communication medium when it is used for sending personal letters, bills, and other matter directed at a particular recipient. For members of the Direct Mail/Marketing Association, however, it is as much a medium of mass communication as radio, television, or newspapers. These advertisers use the mails to send their materials out "to whom it may concern," just as advertisers in other media send their message to the public at large. This is not to imply that the direct mail/marketing people do not attempt to make the mass mailings appear personal; the use of computer technology has made such "personalizing" quite common.

In broadcasting, that call for access is being answered to some extent by the creation of open-access channels in cable television systems. In newspapers, the letters to the editor section serves as that outlet. How­ ever, graffiti provide the most open access of all, as many communicators have obviously discovered. A can of spray paint or a felt pen and a fence, the side of a building, a water tower, a subway train, an overpass, or a wall in a public toilet provide a medium of communication "to whom it may concern."</para>

        <para id="import-auto-idm865165824">Some graffiti, on the other hand, are as much mass communication as the billboards along the highways and as the local newspaper. The scrawled sign on a wall, "Divest now" or "U.S. out of everywhere!" speaks to the concerns of many people today. There is a great range of such messages, from "Gay Rights" to "Beat Illinois."

The colleges hoped that students would use these specially constructed walls instead of painting their antiwar and other messages on the building and sidewalks, where they were costly to remove. Not surprisingly, the ploy did not work. Much of the pleasure from the creation of graffiti clearly comes from putting the messages in forbidden places.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm790014032"><emphasis effect="bold">REVIEW |</emphasis> Graffiti are probably the most open and visible of all our "open-access" channels, especially for antiestablishment messages.</para>

        <title>Exposure to These Other Media </title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm388634880">Throughout this book we have stressed that much of our exposure to the mass media is unplanned and unfocused. We read and hear and see many of the things that we do simply because we happen to encounter them. That unplanned character of exposure is even more true of the media discussed in this chapter than it is of the others. It would be highly unusual for any of us deliberately to set out to see what is on the billboards or bumper stickers today or to search for advertising or public relations letters from direct mail firms (unless we were doing an assignment for class that required such bizarre behavior).</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm392712784">The fact that we do not plan our exposure to these media does not mean it is random, however. Those who design and distribute these various forms of advertising and public relations are quite sophisticated in distributing them in such a way and in such places that make it highly likely that the intended audience will encounter them. So most of us tend to be exposed regularly to a large number of bits of information from these media.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1203274704">You are probably unaware of the frequency of that exposure because most of it occurs at a low level of attention. This is especially the case for exposure to billboards and bumper stickers. Once in a while we are especially attracted to one and attend to it more closely. On the whole, however, our attention is minimal. In spite of that, for the reason explained in Chapter 2, information from these media may be having a substantial effect on those worlds in our heads.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm753817680"><emphasis effect="bold">REVIEW |</emphasis> Virtually all exposure to graffiti, billboards, message buttons, bumper stickers, and direct mail is unplanned '1y the receiver. On the other hand, it is carefully planned by many of the creators of these message forms to ensure maximum exposure by their intended audiences. The low level of attention that results may tend to increase, rather than decrease, the effectiveness of the messages.</para>

      <title>ECONOMIC CONTROLS ON THE MEDIA: A SUMMARY</title>
      <para id="import-auto-idm808851056">This chapter covered the variety of economic factors that affect the types, forms, and content of the mass media. We discussed primarily two of the forms through which those economic factors exert that influence: advertising and public relations. Also influencing the content the media feed into our communication environment, though, are direct and indirect control by owners and the drive to maximize ticket or product sales.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm405376016">Advertising dates back to about 3000 B.C. It has become more pervasive and more sophisticated with time and with advances in technology and research methods.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm1026772608">The modern advertising agency plays important and diverse roles: creative work of all sorts, selecting the media to be used for the transmission of ads, liaison with advertisers, and research on the audience and potential advertising appeals, to name a few.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm403293216">There are three major types of advertising strategies: the direct approach—emphasizing information about the product, the indirect approach—associating the product with something potential consumers find attractive, and the saliency approach—simply making the name or brand of the product impossible to forget. The appropriate strategy depends on the kind of product and the ways most consumers make their decisions for purchasing that product. For these and other reasons, various kinds of research play an important role in the development of a sophisticated advertising campaign.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm805372512">Public relations, in a sense, is a form of advertising, but it involves a far greater range of an individual's, organization's, or business's activities. Public relations also tends to be less obvious than advertising, even though it may exert as much influence on our communication environment as advertising does. We are often exposed to the products of a public relations campaign without being aware that public relations had anything to do with their existence. That is unlikely to happen with the products of advertising; when we see advertising, we usually recognize it as advertising. As a result, public relations may have a greater influence than advertising on that world in our heads.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm340530816">Although public relations is relatively new as a profession, it is a major industry today. It is a rare organization, business, or government agency that does not have at least one person handling public relations. Considering the complexity of today's world and the need of most large organizations to communicate skillfully with a variety of publics, it is difficult to operate without professional public relations help.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm796680096">This chapter considered various types of advertising and public relations, through discussion of some forms of mass communication that are rarely studied: direct mail, buttons and bumper stickers, billboards, and graffiti. We noted the rapid rise in importance of direct mail, especially as it has been facilitated and made more sophisticated through the use of computers. And we noted finally that these forms of mass communication may be "minor" in terms of the conscious attention we pay to them but "major" in terms of the effects they have on the world in our heads—precisely because we are not more conscious of our exposure to them.</para>
