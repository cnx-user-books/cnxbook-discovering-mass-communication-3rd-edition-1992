  <md:title>YOUR FOURTH WORLD: ITS CONSTRUCTION AND RECONSTRUCTION</md:title>
  <md:abstract>Discusses the most important of the "four worlds of information," that is, the world in your head -- "your fourth world" -- and some of the major factors that impact perception, why people process information as they do, factors in media exposure, scripts and schemata, impact of personal characteristics, reference groups, etc. This is originally Chapter 2 in <emphasis>Discovering Mass Communication, 3rd Edition</emphasis>, an introductory mass communication textbook originally published by HarperCollins Publishers in 1991.

It was a highly abstract work titled simply <emphasis effect="italics">Man</emphasis>. The museum patron first stood far back and stared at the painting.

      <para id="import-auto-id1172668619113">That may seem too far-fetched a statement to you, but let us examine it for a moment. If you are like most people, you are, pretty certain you know what a fact is. You have no hesitation in calling some things "fact" and other things "fiction." Stories that an author makes up and descriptions that are inconsistent with your observations you label "fiction," while your account of what you observe, the accounts of others that are consistent with your observations, and the accounts of others whom you trust you label "fact." Fortunately or unfortunately, the world is not that simple. If it were, all of us—you and your parents, your teachers and the local garbage collectors, people in this country, in Iran, and the Soviet Union—would see the world in much more similar ways than we do. The fact is that every observation, even yours, is a <emphasis effect="bold">perception</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">an interpretation of an experience—an interpretation based only in part on that experience and in part on the context of that experience and memory of other experiences</emphasis>. In other words, it is a fiction.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1172668616062">If this claim is hard for you to believe, think again about our story of the man and the painting. No painting of a man is a man. Not even a photograph truly captures the "real" man. It is merely a representation of a man, or of men in general. It is something constructed by the photographer, the camera, and the developer. Obviously, a photograph is affected by the appearance of the object at the moment the shutter is clicked, but that appearance is just one of the factors affecting the final picture.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1172668634142">General semanticists, scholars who study the way people use language in everyday life, have a favorite saying: "The word is not the thing." In the same way, photographs of objects, accounts of events, descriptions of people, or explanations of ideas are not the objects, events, people, or ideas. They are constructions. Thus, the images, accounts, descriptions, and explanations in your head of everything you believe you know are constructions. They are fictions you created that <emphasis effect="italics">represent</emphasis> some parts of the world around you.</para>

Whether or not you accept that generalization, why do you suppose it might be so? Why do people construct different worlds in their heads about chemical warfare, the Middle East, student government, professional football, our president, and the many other people, events, and places about which they observe bits of information directly or through the media? This chapter provides some answers to these questions. These answers, in turn, should help you understand and, to some extent at least, control the way you see your world—the way you construct that world in your head.</para>

      <title>NEGOTIATING OUR MEDIA MOSAICS PERCEPTUALLY</title>
      <para id="import-auto-id1172668612267">In the last chapter we talked about the ways in which individuals physically negotiate their communication environments, exposing themselves more to those media, people, and content that best fit then needs, wants, and styles of life. In this chapter we will discuss the ways in which people negotiate their communication environments <emphasis effect="italics">perceptually</emphasis>, in ways that fit their personal limitations and needs.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1172668999084">To understand communication, you must recognize that there are differences between your perception—what you believe you have seen, heard, or felt—and what is truly there. Perception is a creative process. It is not simply observing, hearing, or sensing what is out there in your environment. It also involves assigning meaning to those stimuli. In fact, what you experience is more a product of your interpretations of information than of the information itself. For example, there is strong evidence that the physiological states associated with being frightened, angered, or pleasantly excited are almost, if not completely, identical. Whether you <emphasis effect="italics">experience</emphasis> fear, anger, or excitement depends on your <emphasis effect="italics">interpretation</emphasis> of those physical states. For example, if you are watching a movie and feel your heart beating faster, you decide whether you are frightened, pleasantly excited, or angry on the basis of whether you are seeing a chase scene or a love scene, or hearing the people behind you loudly talking and munching on strong-smelling popcorn. In all three cases, your physiological response (increased heart rate, blood pressure, and so on) is the same. But the way you <emphasis effect="italics">interpret</emphasis> that response depends on the context or external cues you use to label the emotional state associated with it.</para><para id="import-auto-id1172668530614">In the same way, as the media or other sources stimulate our senses, we interpret those sensations, in part, by associating them with bits of information in memory. Using patterns we have developed over time, we invent a reality and then constantly reinvent it or reshape it as we encounter additional fragments of information. This sort of invention, or the construction and reconstruction of our realities, is something each of us does all of the time in his or her role as receiver. These "pictures in our heads" are important because they represent our perceptions of reality. And, as Walter Lippmann pointed out, even if these pictures are inaccurate, we behave as if they were true. We react not to what is true but to what we <emphasis effect="italics">perceive</emphasis> to be true.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-id7953890">Lippmann's example, described in his famous book on public opinion, is the group of Germans, French, and British who were living on an isolated island when World War I broke out among their countries. It was over six weeks before the islanders discovered they were at war with each other. As Lippmann put it:</para>

      <title>SCRIPTS/SCHEMATA: AIDS TO PERCEPTION</title>
      <para id="import-auto-id1172668628301">Communication scholars refer to those patterns we have developed over time as scripts or schemata. More specifically, <emphasis effect="bold">scripts</emphasis>, or <emphasis effect="bold">schemata</emphasis>, are <emphasis effect="italics">stereotyped sequences of events in memory that are activated by observations or experiences in the present</emphasis>. They are important because they help us organize incoming information so that we can understand it. Put another way, a script gives you a framework for constructing or assigning meaning to new information. Scripts also affect your expectations about the order of events or parts of an event and lead you to fill in missing parts in a particular way. For example, when you read in a novel or newspaper about a character entering a restaurant, your "restaurant going script" is activated, and you automatically fill in missing information: being seated at a table or counter, studying the menu, ordering, being served by the waiter, calculating the tip, paying your bill, and soon.</para><para id="import-auto-id1172669537779">Scripts provide interpretive frameworks for media material that might otherwise be difficult to understand. The following paragraph beautifully illustrates this phenomenon:</para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1172669984510"><quote id="eip-idm238915216">With hocked gems financing him, our hero bravely defied all scornful laughter that tried to prevent his scheme. Your eyes deceive, he had said. An egg, not a table, correctly typifies this unexplored planet. Now three sturdy sisters sought proof. Forging along sometimes through calm vastness, yet more often over turbulent peaks and valleys, days became weeks. As many doubters spread fearful rumors about the edge, at last, from nowhere, welcome winged creatures appeared signifying momentous success.<sup>2</sup></quote>
      </para><para id="import-auto-id1172669750174">Can you make sense of this paragraph? Do the sentences seem to have any relationship to each other? What does it all mean? After thinking about that for a while, read it again, this time with the knowledge that the paragraph comes from a story titled "Christopher Columbus Discovering America." Unless your mind works in very different ways from most people's, that title will activate your "Christopher Columbus script," and you will find it easy to interpret the paragraph within that framework. Not only will you now be more certain that you understand it, you will find that it takes less effort to read.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-id7489537">It may help you understand the way you use the scripts in your head to cope with and interpret experiences if you think of a reporter covering a three-alarm fire or a meeting of the local city council. Exposure to one of those events activates the reporter's "fire script" or "city council script," and the story that results is heavily influenced by the set of expectations that script generates, as well as by the events that occur at the fire or meeting. (We will return to this point in Chapter 14 as we talk about the norms of journalists.)</para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1172671502168"><emphasis effect="bold">REVIEW | </emphasis>Scripts or schemata are patterns or frameworks that we develop on the basis of past experiences. We use them to help us interpret similar experiences in the present.</para>

        <title>Maintaining and Adjusting Our Realities</title>
        <para id="import-auto-id1172669738506">The scripts or pictures of the world in our heads, our realities, have been shaped by our particular experiences, knowledge, needs, values, and beliefs. And they are constantly tested against new fragments of information we sense from our environment. Sometimes these new fragments simply reinforce an existing script. At other times they make the script clearer, add a new element to it, or force a restructuring of it. In these ways, the bits of information we are continually sensing from our communication mosaics cause us to maintain, strengthen, or revise those scripts or pictures in our heads.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id8464278">For example, you have some sort of image or script about Hollywood in your head. Each time you encounter some mention of Hollywood in one of the media, that script is likely to be activated and to aid your interpretation of what you are reading, seeing, or hearing. As you encounter new fragments of information about Hollywood from your communication environment, those fragments have meaning for you only insofar as they fit with the pattern or script in your head that is your prior image of that West Coast wonderland. You may not comprehend a discussion of Hollywood's history unless you have already acquired meanings for such concepts as the Trust, vertical integration, or four-walling (all terms that are defined in Chapter 7).</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1172669641656">This explains why many communicators claim you cannot tell people anything they do not already know. On the face of it, that seems a rather extreme and pessimistic statement, especially for those of us concerned with helping the public become better informed or better educated. But it is more true than false. Neither you nor any member of the mass media audience can perceive or understand anything you cannot relate in some way to your prior experience—that you cannot fit in some way into one of the scripts or realities in your head. In addition, once you process these new fragments of information that fit your script or prior image of the object or idea, these new fragments in turn reshape that image or script.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id6169636">You probably have difficulty accepting that generalization, especially when you think of your visual experiences. Surely, what you see is what is there—at least most of the time. Most likely, you are confident that you can perceive objects you have not seen before, or that you have no meaning for. Surprisingly, though, this is not the case. Testimony in support of that conclusion comes from biologist John Young:</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1172669608462"><quote id="eip-idm939621888">The visual receiving system in its untrained state has only very limited powers. We are perhaps deceived by the fact that the eye is a sort of camera. Contrary to what we might suppose, the eyes and brain do not simply record in a sort of photographic manner the pictures that pass in front of us. The brain is not by any means a simple recording system like a film. . . . Many of our affairs are conducted on the assumption that our sense organs provide us with an accurate record, independent of ourselves. What we are now beginning to realize is that much of this is an illusion, that we have to learn to see the world as we do. . . . In some sense we literally create the world we speak about.<sup>3</sup></quote>
        </para><para id="import-auto-id1172671573806">To put this more plainly, what you see is not the world "out there"; it is the world you created in your mind.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1172668628282">This quality of perception—this demand that a perception be meaningful—helps prevent our being overwhelmed by the infinite number of information fragments in our environments; it helps us select and organize the relatively small number of fragments from our mosaic that we can handle. We do the selecting and organizing in terms of the meaning those fragments have for us.</para>

        <title>Set or Expectation and the Processing of Information</title>
        <para id="import-auto-id1172669488220">Our scripts are shaped not only by our ancient past (going back virtually to birth or even, some would say, into the womb), but also by our very recent past. One important effect of both recent and ancient past is to create expectations or sets, assumptions about the world in which we live. Because of your prior experience, for example, if you hear someone mumbling what sounds like "A, B, C, D," and then something else, your expectation or set leads you to perceive that the person said "E." That is the reality you create. Whatever was said, that part of the world in your head is an "8." A rather simple experiment suggests one of the ways expectations are created and demonstrates their effect.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1172669555641">One communication scholar has studied the way a headline can affect readers' perceptions of what a newspaper story said. He constructed two news stories for this experiment: one about a murder suspect being interrogated by the police, the other about an accelerated program of instruction being developed for a college. For each story he had three headlines, two biased in opposite ways and one neutral. For example, one headline for the murder investigation story suggested the suspect was guilty; the other suggested he was innocent. Subjects who read the story with the "guilty" headline were significantly more likely to conclude that the person was guilty than those who read the same story with the "innocent" headline. Biased headlines did not have the same effect on perceptions of the story about the accelerated college program. This was an issue in which these readers had more of a personal stake, and so they tended to read it more carefully. And, as you might expect, the study found that the more carefully a subject read a story, the less effect the headline had. Careful reading resulted in a more relevant script being evoked, rather than the irrelevant script evoked by the headline.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1172669799067"><emphasis effect="bold">BYLINE | </emphasis>Do you think your perceptions are affected by newspaper headlines? Why do you believe this is so? In the headline study, the researcher found that expectations created by headlines had less effect when people read the stories more carefully. Do most people read, listen, or view the media carefully enough to counteract the effect of expectation? Do you?</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1172670163986">Our knowledge of and attitudes toward a newspaper or columnist, newscaster or station, or perhaps even toward the mass media in general probably act in the same way as a headline. They affect our set or expectations; hence, they affect the way we perceive the information received from those media.</para>

        <title>The Absence of Set or Expectation: Passive Perception</title>
        <para id="import-auto-id6944731">The research described thus far involves the effect of expectation or set  on perception. But what about your perception of material that you happen to see or hear or read for which you have no prior expectation? This may be the case when you listen to a radio or television station you have not heard before, or read a newspaper story without noticing the headline and without prior information about the event. Normally, unless you are almost totally passive during that exposure, you will quickly develop expectations based on the first bits of information you notice—the opening scene of a drama, the introductory lines of a news story, or the first bars of music. From then on, all of the effects of expectation apply.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1172668853726">If you remain passive during such exposure to the media, developing no expectations of what is to come, the effects are less certain. In fact, total passivity may not even be possible unless you are asleep or hypnotized or are paying no attention to the medium. Assuming such passivity is possible, it seems likely you will not understand as much of the information as you would otherwise. You will not have the aid of a relevant script that may be stored in your memory, and therefore you will not have the aid of appropriate expectations. Expectations make media content easier to grasp, as long as that content is reasonably consistent with them—as it usually is. Returning to an earlier example, when someone is reciting the alphabet in the normal order, your expectations help you "hear" and perceive accurately what is being said. If the letters are being recited in random order, you will have more trouble grasping them because you have no expectations to help. On the other hand, when a mistake is made in the normal recitation of the alphabet, you are more likely to pick it up if you have no expectations but are listening carefully.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1172671572710">Just as expectations that are reasonably consistent with the material you are hearing, reading, or seeing make that material easier to understand, expectations also make them easier to remember. Scripts serve not only as aids in interpreting information, but also as useful frameworks for recalling that information.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1172669609190">Whether you realize it or not, you are generally fairly good at predicting much of what you are exposed to—the next word, the next sound, the next turn of the plot. On the whole, these expectations help you process, comprehend, and remember the bits of information you sense from your communication mosaic. We will return to this concept of expectation when we discuss the way you use those bits of information to fill the gaps in the meanings you construct.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1172669746457"><emphasis effect="bold">REVIEW | </emphasis>In general, expectations help us understand what we read, hear, see, or feel. These expectations can be caused by scripts based on similar experiences, by cues—such as newspaper headlines, or by the early part of the experience itself.

In the meantime, these existing theories provide some useful insights. <emphasis effect="bold">Variety theory</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="bold">consistency theory</emphasis>, for example, explain why people differ in the degree to which they seek or are receptive to information and why each of us is sometimes receptive and sometimes unreceptive.</para>

But in addition, most of us seem to need them more at some times than at other times.

You can probably recall times when information that contradicted your attitudes or beliefs made you uncomfortable. For example, if you are very close with all members of your family, knowledge that one of them has done something dishonest can make you quite uneasy. Similarly, if you are a strong supporter of the president, negative information about him is somewhat disturbing. Or if you are a fan of your college athletic teams, any information that they have violated conference regulations can make you uncomfortable. All of us seem to feel internal pressure to avoid such discomfort. This pressure is so strong within some of us all of the time, and within most of us at least some of the time, that we tend to avoid information that might conflict with our beliefs. At the same time, and for the same reason, we are more likely to seek or pay attention to information that is consistent with our beliefs.

          <title>Impact on perceptions. </title>
          <para id="import-auto-id1172669534998">Just as attitudes, personality, and expectations tend to affect exposure to information, they also affect perceptions. A large number of studies and many of our personal experiences have demonstrated that most of us tend to perceive messages from the mass media or elsewhere in a way that is consistent with our beliefs and attitudes. This means that we tend to misperceive messages that are not consistent with them.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-id1172668651610">You have probably seen some of the many reruns of the television series "M*A*S*H" that have flooded the airways for a number of years. A pacifist with very strong attitudes against war is likely to perceive this series as a depiction of the senselessness and futility of war. Someone without strong feelings on the subject probably sees it simply as a comedy, with no special "message." On the other hand, someone who believes firmly that America is always right, that it enters wars only to make the world a freer and safer place, probably sees "M*A*S*H" as a demonstration of the courage of America's "citizen soldiers" under fire. <emphasis effect="italics">The tendency to interpret or perceive information in a way that makes it consistent with one's prior knowledge, attitudes, and behavior</emphasis> is called <emphasis effect="bold">selective perception</emphasis>.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-id1172668824524">A study of partisan viewing of the film of a football game has provided additional evidence of the way people's attitudes create a set or expectation that in turn affects perception. Students from the teams' schools who watched the film reported "seeing" twice as many rule violations committed by players from the other school as by players from their own school. Regardless of which school the viewers were from, the same phenomenon occurred; they always perceived more violations by the other side.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-id1172668538704">Two explanations for these phenomena have been suggested. The explanation accepted by most scholars is a version of the consistency theory described earlier. One way in which we avoid the discomfort caused by inconsistency is to misperceive any new information that is not consistent with our attitudes or behaviors. For example, if you are prejudiced against political conservatives, and your local newspaper publishes a story that is favorable to Vice-President Dan Quayle, you can avoid inconsistency by perceiving the story as somehow damaging to Quayle, or you can discredit the newspaper, accusing it of distorting the news.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-id1172670162245">The other explanation of this effect of attitudes and expectations on perceptions is the <emphasis effect="bold">principle of least effort</emphasis>. This is <emphasis effect="italics">the theory that people perceive things in the simplest or easiest way they can, and it is easiest to perceive them in ways consistent with their prior expectations, attitudes, or beliefs</emphasis>. It takes more effort to perceive a message that is contrary to the way you see the world or that is different than what you expect.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-id1172668884557"><emphasis effect="bold">REVIEW | </emphasis>Selective perception can be explained either by consistency theory or the principle of least effort. Consistency theory argues that all of us feel pressure to avoid discomfort by keeping our knowledge, our behaviors, and our attitudes consistent.

        <title>The Influence of Needs </title>
        <para id="import-auto-id1172668637876">The need to maintain consistency among, our attitudes, beliefs, and actions is only one class of needs. Other kinds of needs also influence our exposure and perception: the needs or drives for power, security, social esteem, and self-esteem. Individuals vary greatly in their drive to satisfy each of these needs. In addition, for each of us, some of these needs are felt more strongly at some times than at others. As a result, at times you probably actively seek information to satisfy some particular need; at other times, you attend to such information only when you happen to encounter it and perceive that it can serve your needs. In addition, you probably encounter and notice a certain amount of information that serves no apparent need.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1172670657321"><emphasis>REVIEW |</emphasis> Many kinds of needs affect the way we process information: more-or-less permanent needs, such as our needs for self esteem, social esteem, security, and power, as well as momentary needs such as hunger.</para><section id="import-auto-id1172668654743">
          <title>Needs and information processing.</title>
          <para id="import-auto-id1172668610488">Your needs are also important factors in the way you process information. The probability is high that you usually process or perceive the information you encounter in a way that is relevant to the needs you feel most strongly at that moment. When you are hungry you are more likely to notice the food present in a dramatic scene in a movie than when you are not hungry. Similarly, if you dislike a character in a movie, you are more likely to interpret what that person does as showing negative attributes than if you like or admire him or her. If the character you dislike is very polite to elderly people, you are likely to see it as a sign of phoniness or showing off, whereas you will see it as a sign of thoughtfulness or good breeding in someone you like.</para>

          <title>Reference groups and information processing.</title>
          <para id="import-auto-id1172671573560">Just as our needs affect what we select from the communication environment, how we process or interpret that material, and what we remember of it, so too do our <emphasis effect="bold">reference groups</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">the groups of individuals with whom we identify and to whom we look for guidance or reinforcement</emphasis>. Thus, our information processing is affected by our family, friends, and others with whom we associate or with whom we would like to associate. We interact with these groups and test our interpretations of what we read, hear, and see. As a result, our scripts are shaped by those interactions with other people, just as they are shaped to some extent by our interactions with the media.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-id1172668949944">As you know, the interpretations of our family, friends, and others who are important to us are not always consistent with each other. In these instances, we see an interesting phenomenon. When we are exposed to material in the company of our family, we process it in a way more consistent with their pattern. On the other hand, when we are exposed to the same material in the company of friends, we process it in a different way—in a way more consistent with the pattern of these friends. In a sense, we use a different script for interpreting this material, depending on our social context.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-id1172669039186"><emphasis>BYLINE |</emphasis> Try this mental experiment to test our claim about the effect of social context. Imagine watching an NC-17-rated movie with some of your college friends. Now imagine watching the same movie with your parents or a much younger sibling.

How would they probably differ?</para><para id="import-auto-id1172669041695">We would predict that you would "see" quite a different movie when watching that NC-17-rated film in the company of your parents or a younger sibling than watching it in the company of friends.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-id1172668598906">Even the expectation of being with one of these groups in the near future can affect your processing of media content.

You might be influenced by quite a different script in each of those instances.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-id3520066">In these ways, reference groups shape our sets or expectations for certain kinds of information. Some evidence even suggests that any audience with whom you are listening to or observing one of the mass media tends to be a type of reference group for you at the moment.

          <title>Reference groups and opinions/behaviors. </title>
          <para id="import-auto-id1172669032198">As you probably know, those of us who study mass communication audiences rely heavily on surveys in our research. We are constantly interviewing people or sending them questionnaires. Many of these surveys include opinion or attitude questions such as "What do you think about the president's proposal to reduce federal aid to education?" Or "What is your reaction to the proposal to raise tuition 6 percent in this college?" We ask these kinds of questions again and again and publish the results in newspapers or scholarly journals. However, some scholars have criticized such questions. They claim, with some justification, that when we ask questions of these sorts we are not simply <emphasis effect="italics">measuring</emphasis> opinions; we are <emphasis effect="italics">creating</emphasis> opinions. Many people we ask about the president's proposal or the tuition proposal would not have thought about it before we asked their opinion. Therefore, they had no opinion <emphasis effect="italics">until we asked the question</emphasis>. Once they are asked, though, most of them think about it and come up with an opinion. The question is, are the public opinion pollsters or the scholars who measure opinions in this way misleading themselves and the rest of us by claiming their results are meaningful?</para><para id="import-auto-id1172668598189">At first glance, it might appear they are misleading, that such research is invalid. But that initial reaction is wrong. When pollsters create opinions that did not exist in some people before they were asked questions about them, these researchers are duplicating the conditions under which most, if not all, of us form our opinions. Let us explain.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-id1172669103607">We do not form opinions simply because we are exposed to some information. Just because we read or hear about a proposal from the president does not mean we form an opinion about it. In most cases, our development of an opinion depends on whether someone confronts us with a question about it, or on our anticipating that we will be talking with someone else about it. The opinion or point of view we then develop is in part a function of who the other individual is and of our relationship to him or her. Thinking about this other person in connection with the information we encountered affects the way we organize and use that information.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-id1172668639716">Thus, the opinions we developed about the federal aid proposal or the tuition increase are not solely the result of our individual analyses and beliefs. They are heavily influenced by our reference groups, especially those with whom we are interacting or expect to be interacting on the subject. Most of your opinions, whether you realize it or not, are strongly influenced by the people around you. And, thus, the opinions you develop and state when confronted with a public opinion pollster are probably reasonable approximations of the opinions you would develop when interacting with other strangers about those topics.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-id1172671572279">Another way to think about this matter is to consider each of your reference groups as a type of "audience" for you. That "audience" can affect your perceptions and your other behaviors, even when it is not present. In fact, an audience that is not present can sometimes affect you more than one that is. For example, consider a physician speaking to a lay audience about some particular health problem. She is probably constantly conscious of how her medical colleagues will view what she is saying. Thus, her remarks—and, hence, her points of view—are shaped by that absent audience.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-id1172668656948">Let us consider an example closer to home. Think about the behavior of college professors talking to an undergraduate class—perhaps the authors of this book talking to your class. The way we behave, the way we perceive information and talk about it to you, is influenced not only by that information and by you who are in this class, but also by our perceptions of our colleagues and how they would react to what we are saying. In fact, our comments on this page are influenced by at least two reference groups who will probably never see what we have written. One is that set of professional colleagues. The other is the set of friends who are strong feminists. It is the existence of this latter reference group that led us to refer to the physician in this example as "she." This reference group has increased the probability that when we read the word "physicians" or "police officers," we will construct in our minds an image of women as well as of men.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-id1172668655420">So be aware of the way your language, your behavior, and the way you process or perceive mass media messages are affected by the people with whom you interact. Even when absent, they affect what you think you are "seeing" and "hearing" in the mass media. When you hear people talking about the <emphasis effect="bold">social construction of reality</emphasis>, it is this phenomenon to which they are referring, at least in part. <emphasis effect="italics">Our beliefs and interpretations of information, even our definitions of words and other symbols, are influenced by the people with whom we interact.</emphasis> Thus, the realities we create in our minds are, to some extent, social constructions because they are influenced by our reference groups.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-id1172668564838">Some scholars believe the influence of other people on our processing of information is even more basic than we have suggested. They take the position that the reality each of us constructs from our communication mosaics is an <emphasis effect="bold">intersubjective reality</emphasis>. According to this theory, <emphasis effect="italics">people's beliefs about the world are shaped in part by comparing them to the beliefs of other people</emphasis>. We constantly test our perceptions of reality as we interact with others.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-id1172668529329"><emphasis effect="bold">REVIEW |</emphasis> The world in our heads is a product of the information we heard, read, and saw, that we processed, and that we then tested and refined through our interactions with other individuals, especially our reference groups.

          <title>Personality traits. </title>
          <para id="import-auto-id1172669024219">Another influence on your information processing is your personality. At least one personality trait, <emphasis effect="bold">dogmatism</emphasis>, has even been defined by some social scientists in terms of the way we process information.<sup>4</sup> Dogmatism is <emphasis effect="italics">the degree to which people are unable to perceive or evaluate information independent of their prior attitudes, beliefs, and needs, the source of the information, and its context</emphasis>.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-id1172668846863">The more you receive, evaluate, and act on information from your environment on its own merits, uninfluenced by irrelevant information or by your attitudes, beliefs, or needs, the more open-minded you are. On the other hand, the more your reception, evaluation, and actions concerning that information are influenced by your attitudes, beliefs, and needs or by irrelevant information, the more dogmatic or closed-minded you are. For example, the more your evaluation of a disarmament plan is affected by whether the idea came from the president, Mikhail Gorbachev, or your roommate, the more closed-minded you are, according to this definition. The more your judgment of the quality of a motion picture is affected by knowing who the director was or by the judgments of your friends, the more closed-minded you are. Or the more easily you can be fooled by a visual illusion, the more closed-minded you are. Research has shown that a closed-minded person usually has extreme difficulty isolating an object or idea and evaluating or perceiving it independently of its context. Similarly, when a closed-minded individual is evaluating a newspaper column or broadcast commentary, he or she is more affected by the knowledge of its author's identity than is the person with an open-minded belief system. The closed-minded or dogmatic individual is especially influenced by authority figures.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-id1172671579095">Dogmatic persons also have difficulty tolerating ambiguity. They have a strong tendency to categorize everything immediately. Such persons, when trying to solve problems, have difficulty thinking about them in more than one way. When they first encounter a problem, they assume it must be solved in a particular way. Even when that doesn't work, they can't seem to shake themselves loose from that frame of reference—that way of thinking. Consider, for example, the problem of connecting these nine dots with four straight lines:</para>
          <para id="eip-965"><media id="nine_dot_problem" alt="The nine dot problem consists of 3 rows of 3 dots.">

</media></para><para id="import-auto-id1172668989715">The four straight lines must be formed without lifting pen or pencil from the paper and without retracing all or part of any line.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-id1172668548774">What do you perceive when exposed to those nine dots? You probably perceive a square, and that square becomes a frame of reference. In weighing the problem, it is difficult to even consider solutions that go outside the frame of reference—that go outside the square. Yet, you must go outside that frame of reference to solve the problem. Presumably, the individual with the closed-minded belief system will fail to do so, whereas the individual with an open-minded belief system is more likely to solve the problem by going outside the frame of reference and drawing the lines more or less as shown on page 54.</para>

        <title>Your Language and Information Processing </title>
        <para id="import-auto-id1172669067863">Still another influence on the way we process or construct meanings from the material we read, see, and hear in the mass media is our language. Even when you are exposed to nonverbal material, such as a photograph, your language plays a large role in the way you process that information. Your everyday language, the language with which you are most familiar, gives you a set of categories or frames in which to "see" things.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1172671583335">Earlier we talked about patterns or scripts we acquire from past experiences and then use to organize and interpret new experiences. In a sense, our language serves that same function. The fact that we have the word "tree" and the word "bush" increases the probability that we will see the distinction between these different kinds of vegetation growing in our back yards. Having different words for each helps you see greater differences than you would if you had only one word to use for both.</para><para id="import-auto-id1172668958119">The most famous example of this phenomenon is that described by linguist Benjamin Whorf, a pioneer in the study of the influence of language on thought.<sup>5</sup> Whorf observed that Eskimos have many words for describing snow, in contrast to the single word available in English. He attributes this variety of labels to Eskimos' greater ability to perceive small differences among various kinds of snow. English-speaking people, on the other hand, can do little more than distinguish snow from rain or sleet.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1172668960715">Words helps us objectify—to give meaning to the mass media material we encounter as well as to our other experiences in the world. If you had no word for homosexual, if you had never heard that word or the word "gay" or any other word that signified that particular concept, it is unlikely you would perceive that distinction among people in a motion picture or television drama. That is, you would not make the distinction between gays and heterosexuals. Without knowledge of that word or concept, you probably would interpret signs of affection between two men or between two women on the screen in quite a different way than you do now.</para>

One of the important differences in eating style is the size of the bite. Some people eat their food quickly, in large bites; others go slowly, taking one small bite at a time. Just as our bites of food can vary in size, so our bites of information can vary in size—we can "chunk" our information in large, medium-sized, or small bites. You can see this clearly if you examine the ways different people read. Some individuals fixate on one word at a time. Others fixate on a phrase or a line at a time, chunking in larger units. Similarly, in watching a television program you can fixate upon the larger story line and not "see" some of the details of costume, set, light, and other elements, or you can fixate on these details and perhaps fail to grasp some of the program's plot or theme. Thus, when we talk about <emphasis effect="bold">chunking</emphasis> in communication, we are referring to <emphasis effect="italics">the size of the information bits or the number of information bits you are attending to at one time</emphasis>.</para><para id="import-auto-id1172669680834">With reading, at least, you can cover more ground—read faster—by chunking in larger units. Some experts say you also have a better chance of grasping major ideas when you chunk in larger units. However, you probably miss some of the detail—the nuances of language, particular differences in sentence construction, and so on. Which type of reading is better depends on your purpose in reading. When you are proofreading newspaper copy, for instance, you probably ought to chunk by words or, at times, even by letters. When you are reading something to see if it has information about Iraq, you probably ought to chunk by phrases or lines of type.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-id1172668657425">These differences in chunking style probably account for many students' observation after they have taken a television or film production class that they no longer enjoy television programs or movies as much. They tend to notice the editing and the other techniques of production, and this distracts them and prevents them from enjoying the show. They have not yet learned to control their chunking behavior so it will be appropriate for their viewing purposes.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-id1172668616220">One theory of memory suggests that chunking—grouping items together to reduce the number of individual units to retain—helps us remember more material. We retain the group as a unit, rather than remembering each individual item. It seems that an editor of a newspaper or a newscast can help audience members do this by precoding for them, grouping similar or related items. The result should be better recall of the items by readers, listeners, or viewers.</para>

        <para id="import-auto-id1172669688044">When considering the role of prior exposure in information processing, a good starting place is the saying attributed to Greek philosopher Heraclitus who lived in the fifth or sixth century B.C.: "You can't step into the same river twice." Not only is there constant change in the river—in our case, the communication mosaic—there is also constant change in you. Each prior experience, however slight, changes you in some respect. Each bit of information that you sense affects your response to later information, especially to related, similar, or "identical" information. It appears, in other words, that repetition affects you even when you do not recall your prior exposure to the information. Support for this generalization is found in studies that show you will learn things more quickly if you have learned them before and forgotten them than if you never knew them. It is likely, then, that the second or third time you get a particular bit of information (about a kidnapping or about the president, for example)—even if you do not recall getting that information before—it has a different effect than it had the first time.</para></section>

        <para id="import-auto-id1172670800554">One body of evidence suggests that repetition of persuasive messages—that is, hearing a persuasive message such as a political commercial more than once—causes people to agree more rapidly with the statement of opinion. Repetition has also been shown to affect choice of a product. However, we do not know whether a commercial can be played too often, whether there is a point of diminishing returns—or even a reversal—after a certain amount of repetition. Nor do we know much about the effect of short or long time periods between repetitions of the message, although some evidence suggests that a broadcast commercial is more effective if it comes in bursts rather than being evenly distributed over a long period of time. Thus, if you are going to run for political office and can afford an average of only one commercial a day throughout the campaign period, you are probably wiser to schedule seven commercials on one day each week, instead of running just one commercial every day.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1172669105922">Repetition can also occur across as well as within media. Thus you can boost your political candidacy by transmitting your name or campaign slogan through a variety of media so voters will likely encounter it repeatedly, not only when they listen to the radio but also when they turn from radio to the newspaper, when they pass some billboards, when they see people sporting political buttons, and so on.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1172668855386">With enough repetition, even mere exposure, with no apparent attempt at persuasion, seems to affect attitude. For example, one study showed that the more frequently subjects were exposed to some Chinese symbols whose meanings they did not know, the more likely they were to believe that the symbols represented something "good." This suggests that just showing minority group members in advertisements so that the audience is exposed to them frequently may have a positive effect on attitudes toward these groups, at least among children who have no preconceived notions about these groups.</para>

The shape of those nine dots was familiar to anyone raised in a western culture; it immediately brought to mind a square, a concept for which you have a well-established script in your memory. Therefore, you probably tried to close the gaps among those dots by completing the square. However, if you did, you found it impossible to do so without lifting your pen or pencil from the paper and without retracing any lines.

      <para id="import-auto-id1172668555852">Critics have argued whether this and similar books comprise a new literary genre, or whether they are simply part of a continuum on which every piece of literature lies. In a sense, every work of fiction contains some germ of fact. No writer can make a story out of nothing; he or she must build on experience with people and events. Thus, every story is some blend of fact and fiction.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1172669026670">Some literary theorists have gone even further. Just as any novel can be read, in some sense, as a description of reality, any piece of writing that purports to be a description of reality, for example, a work of history, can be read as fiction. It is impossible to truly recreate the past. All a historian can do is tell a story that is an analogy or model of the past. In the same way, news stories are, to some extent, fiction—selective interpretations of events as filtered through the eyes and camera angles and words of observers, journalists, and editors and molded into coherent stories.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1172671574250">Just as many contemporary literary critics and theorists are trying to break down the boundaries between literature and nonliterature, so are critics and theorists of mass communication beginning to break down the boundary between news and entertainment. Wheri., one considers that most news or information is almost immediately used in entertainment, this breakdown seems essential. The latest news event becomes, almost overnight, part of the plot of soap operas, made-for-television movies, and situation comedies.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1172668629001">This incorporation of nonentertainment into entertainment has been going on since the beginnings of literature and drama. The Greek dramas and the early religious dramas were attempts to communicate moral lessons and the events of the day in more interesting and effective ways. The songs of wandering minstrels centuries ago were essentially news stories set to music. The extreme of this confounding of literature and nonliterature can be seen in the work of a poet some years ago who found a unique source for his creations. His "poems" consisted of classified advertisements, unchanged except for the arrangement of the lines.</para><para id="import-auto-id1172668854266">So when we see a motion picture about the latest million-dollar robbery or the latest war, is it any less "real" than the newspaper or television news account of the event? Both are selective. Both are translations of the event into words and pictures. The only difference is that one claims to be news and the other claims to be fiction or entertainment or, sometimes, <emphasis effect="bold">docudrama</emphasis>—<emphasis effect="italics">a blend of documentary and dramatization</emphasis>. In fact, the news story, like the dramatization, is both news and fiction; neither can possibly be anything else.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1172668977520"><emphasis effect="bold">BYLINE |</emphasis> Instances have been documented of a television network having people restage news occurrences so they could be videotaped for broadcast on news programs. Is this practice consistent with responsible journalism? What about docudramas? Why might one consider the creation of docudramas ethical but the recreation of news events for broadcast on news programs unethical?</para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1172669069860">Looking at the reverse side of this coin, we can see that the news and informational or educational materials presented through the media also incorporate elements of fiction or entertainment. When we report in the newspaper or newscast about a city council meeting, a women's basketball game, or the latest doings of the student senate, how do we shape that material? We shape it into a "story"—a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end—a story with a plot and, if we are clever enough, a story with a villain and a hero or heroine.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1172669039508">It is interesting, by the way, that as our news stories and documentaries take on more and more the form of traditional fiction, much of fiction is taking on more and more the form—or formlessness—of events out in the world, without beginning, middle, or end; without heroes, heroines, or villains; without logical order. At its most extreme, this form of literature gives us an almost random set of bits of information from which each reader creates his or her own story.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1172668626533">The point of all this—the effect of all of these phenomena—is that just as the boundaries between news and entertainment have broken down in good part for the creators of those forms of mass communication, so have they broken down for the consumers of those forms: for you and us as the audience. In fact, for us consumers, they may have broken down even more. We probably can make no meaningful distinction between them in their impact on the creation of our realities. Entertainment can shape that world in our heads—our images of reality—as much as news can; at times it can shape it even more.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1172668590276">As evidence, consider the Korean War. It is an important part of our history. You probably have some conception of Korea and of that war; it is part of the world in your head, even if you were not alive when it occurred. You almost certainly were exposed to historical accounts in some of your high school and, perhaps, college classes. You may have read about it or talked to a parent, relative, or friend who took part in that war. So you have been exposed to so-called "factual" accounts. If we could examine that part of the world in your head that is the Korean War, though, it would be a safe bet that more of that world was constructed from bits of information you got from reruns of "M*A*S*H" than from all of those factual accounts.</para><para id="import-auto-id1172668626072">Not only is this true for those who were not alive in that day; it is true for those who were and who followed the war day by day in the newspapers and newscasts. We would not be surprised if it were true even for some of the people who actually participated in that war. As time has passed, the fiction has become more real than the actual, on-the-scene experiences. So, as you think about your impressions of reality—that world in your head—and as you attempt to gain greater control over its future construction and reconstruction, try to be sensitive to the fact that some of the building blocks come from that part of your mosaic environment that is fiction or entertainment.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1172668979232"><emphasis effect="bold">REVIEW |</emphasis> There is far less difference between news reports and many forms of entertainment than most people realize. Both contain elements of fact and fiction and both can be "read" as either fact or fiction.</para>

      <title>WHY ALL OF THESE FACTORS AFFECT OUR INFORMATION PROCESSING </title>
      <para id="import-auto-id1172669014711">Why do all of the effects discussed in this chapter occur? At least part of the reason is that each of us is faced with far more information than we can take in and process in a rational way. We can cope with only a small part of that information and must make inferences about much of the rest; we must fill the gaps left by what we skimmed over or simply missed. We do this in part by anticipating what the information will be. We anticipate the future in the only way we can: through inference based on prior experience. Then, when the future becomes the present—or the past—we have some check on our inference; either it worked or it didn't work. The results of this test affect the kind of inference we make in the future—our expectation.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1172668948942">These unconscious processes of perception are much like the processes a scientist goes through consciously. Each. time we perceive something in our communication environment, it is as though we are experimentally testing a hypothesis about what that thing is. Our hypothesis—or expectation—is then confirmed and reinforced or disconfirmed and modified according to the results of the test. For example, from the fragments of sports news that we accept from the media, we make an inference about whether it will be worthwhile to buy a season ticket for the football games. Our experiences in the stadium serve to confirm or deny the inference. That confirmation or lack of confirmation, in turn, affects the way we perceive or make inferences from future sports news we encounter.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1172669041044">Many scholars today talk about <emphasis effect="bold">information overload</emphasis>, by which they mean <emphasis effect="italics">the constant exposure to more information than individuals can process</emphasis>. These scholars assume that, because of all of the new communications technologies, the amount of information overload is far greater than it has ever been in the past. We believe that assumption is wrong. Information overload is not the result of the increasing amounts of processed information coming at us from the mass media. Those who claim it is fail to consider the fact that not all of our information comes from the media and, even more important, that we have always had communication overload—more stimuli or fragments of information available to each of us than we can handle. Just look out of the window and try to notice every single thing. Obviously, that is an impossible task, for there are almost an infinite number of minute fragments in that scene. An examination of one of your hands may provide a clearer example. Under normal circumstances, we perceive little more than its grossest characteristics. A careful examination, however, shows that we could study one of our hands for a long time and still not see all that is there. Look at the myriad lines, various colors, hairs, and interesting shapes. And each finger is unique. The hand contains far more information than we can absorb. But normally we do not even try to absorb all of it; there is no need to do so. We abstract what we need and ignore the rest. This is precisely what we do when we process information we receive from the mass media.</para><para id="import-auto-id1172668625052"><emphasis effect="bold">REVIEW |</emphasis> Many of the unconscious processes of perception—such as chunking or filling gaps in the array of information to which we are exposed—occur because most of us are confronted with more information than we can handle easily. These processes help us cope with this information overload.</para>

      <title>HOW AND WHY WE PROCESS INFORMATION AS WE DO: A SUMMARY </title>
      <para id="import-auto-id1172668885609">The major point of this chapter is that the perception or understanding of your communication environment is a creative process in which you are engaged throughout all of the waking hours of your lifetime. We looked at the major factors that affect that creative process—that affect the way you construct and constantly reconstruct all of the meanings that fill the world in your head.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1172669088104">We talked about two major sets of factors that affect the way you process information. One set is composed of all of your personal qualities and habits that influence the way you see your environment. Central to these personal characteristics are the patterns we called "scripts" or "schemata" that you built up over the years. These scripts were shaped by your particular experiences, knowledge, needs, values, and beliefs. You match incoming stimuli against these scripts and use what seems to be the most relevant script to organize, fill in, and make sense of each set of stimuli. These scripts are not static; they are constantly evolving as you encounter new information and as you test their validity. It does not take much interaction with other people for you to learn which of your interpretations of information from your communication mosaic are sharply inconsistent with the interpretations of others. A friend might have said to you, "You thought that movie was a comedy? You certainly didn't see the same movie I did." Such reactions can bring a sharp change in the script you use to assess that sort of movie in the future.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1172668531353">Another major function of a script is to shape your expectation or set, making it easier to process and to remember information. Your needs, attitudes, and beliefs also affect your expectations in such a way that you are more likely to perceive and remember messages that are consistent with them; you are less likely to perceive or remember messages that are inconsistent with them.</para><para id="import-auto-id1172669757290">People who are close to you—family members, friends, others with whom you identify—also affect the set with which you approach the media, how you process information you encounter, and what you remember of that information. These people are your reference groups. Just being in the company of one of these reference groups when you are being exposed to a television program, movie, or some other media content, or just being aware that you soon will be in their company, can affect what you see in that content and what you bring away from that experience. Reference groups affect you in this way because each one's presence or expected presence tends to activate a different script. In addition, each of your reference groups is a type of audience for you. And the kinds of ideas you are likely to extract or construct from your media experiences for one of these audiences (such as your friends) is often quite different from the kinds you are likely to construct for another of these audiences (such as your parents).</para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1172669726982">Another major factor in the way you process information from your communication mosaic is your language. That language influences the kinds of things you see and the kinds of distinctions you make. Words are necessary tools for making sense of your environment.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1172669645951">Your construction of the world in your head is influenced not only by your personal characteristics or internal environment, but also by the characteristics of the information you encounter in your external environment. Among the many characteristics of that information is its redundancy or repetitiveness. The more often you encounter information; the greater influence it tends to have on you. Similarly, the order in which you receive bits of information affects both which ones you are likely to recall and which ones you are more likely to believe. However, as we saw in this chapter, the effect of order varies with circumstances.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1172668627150">Although it may seem odd to you to call the absence of information a characteristic of messages, that is precisely what a gap is. As we noted, no message is complete; every message has gaps that its recipient must fill in. Here again, the scripts we have stored in memory play an important role in determining how those gaps are filled.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1172668603636">Another interesting characteristic of the messages we encounter in our communication mosaics is their relative iconicity or, at the opposite extreme, their symbolic value. We noted that the less iconic a message or stimulus, the more likely most receivers are to perceive a general rather than a specific referent. For example, we are more likely to think of all mankind or humanity when we see a highly abstract drawing of a man than when we see a realistic photograph of a particular male.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1172668971774">The last major characteristic of messages that we discussed was their context. Context affects the interpretation of information in a great variety of ways. For example, it can increase the probability that you will perceive a stimulus as a symbol, rather than as something standing only for itself.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1172670378605">In characterizing mass media messages, the distinction between "entertainment" and "information" or "news" is often considered highly important. If we think of the effects of these two forms, and the way they appear to blend into each other in our contemporary media environment, the distinction between them may not be nearly as important as many of us believed. People get a great deal of useful information from what we generally label entertainment and find much entertainment in what we label news.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1172670799853">In explaining the various effects of both our internal characteristics and the characteristics of our external communication environment, we suggested that we perceive or process information much the way scientists explore the world. Our scripts provide hypotheses about how to interpret information, and we test those hypotheses as we interact with other people and as we respond in other ways. In the process, we discover that some of our hypotheses work and some do not. As a result, we either reinforce those scripts in our head or revise them, and continue our eternal journey of exploration through our communication mosaics.</para>
