  <md:title>MAGAZINES: THE SPECIAL INTEREST MEDIUM</md:title>
  <md:abstract>Traces the history of the magazine in America from colonial times to 1990, including discussion of the demise of the general interest magazine and the trend toward specialization, the changes in corporate structure and ownership in the magazine industry, the creative and marketing aspects of the majazine industry, and the functions and effects of magazines. This is originally Chapter 5 in <emphasis>Discovering Mass Communication, 3rd Edition</emphasis> by Samuel L. Becker and Churchill L. Roberts, an introductory mass communication textbook originally published by HarperCollins Publishers in 1991. The publisher returned the copyright to Samuel L. Becker shortly before his death in 2012. His estate has given permission to make the entire text available on OpenStax CNX.</md:abstract>

There are still groups of people out there who share some special interest or some special way of life and who need a magazine to serve that interest or way of life. And those groups are evolving all the time, faster than the demographers and marketers can keep up with them. And even when the demographers and marketers find them, these groups still may not comprise magazine audiences. Ah, but those who do; those are the ones we look for. In publishing, we dream about those groups with their intense need for magazines to help them, to inform them, to provide them with ideas, information, and inspiration.

</quote></para><para id="import-auto-id1170589638671">James Autry's remarks aptly describe the magazine publishing business, which has been called "a colorful, many-headed, every-changing, festive dragon." Indeed it is. Every year some three hundred new magazines representing a veritable patchwork of colors, sizes, and type styles try to find their niche in the American marketplace. In the June 1989, debut issue of a fashion magazine called <emphasis effect="italics">Mirabella</emphasis>, the publication's director and namesake Grace Mirabella said her first thought was, "Who needs another magazine?" Ultimately she decided that no fashion magazine dealt with "style" in the broadest sense of the word.</para>

Fewer than half will last a year; fewer than 20 percent will last four years. <emphasis effect="italics">Manhattan, Inc</emphasis>., which won a 1985 National Magazine Award and critical acclaim for its exposes of business practices in New York City, folded in 1990. The magazine <emphasis effect="italics">7 Days</emphasis> received a similar award in April, 1990. Ironically, it had gone out of business the week before. Still, there is that insatiable and tremendously varied appetite for reading material that propels the industry forward—in search of that magic group for whom just the right magazine might be created.</para><para id="import-auto-id1170589467968">Because of their variability, magazines are probably the most difficult of the media to define. A comparison with newspapers makes clear the reason for the difficulty. The vast bulk of newspapers are fairly similar to each other in types of content, layout, and style of writing. They include roughly the same proportion of national and international news, local news, sports, features, and advertising. Some have more comic strips than others, but most have at least a couple. If you moved from one city to another, you could probably pick up a newspaper that you had never seen before and know where to find the sports section or the latest news about the president.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1170589157522">Such is not the case with magazines. No magazines or type of magazine can be called "typical." In a sense, each one has or creates its own audience—its own "community" of readers. Although these readers are generally scattered across the country and unknown to each other, they have common interests defined, and often created, by the magazine. In many cases, these readers share a specialized vocabulary. The validity of this idea of a community defined by the readership of a magazine is obvious when you consider business or trade magazines. It is less obvious, though no less valid, for many other kinds of magazines, such as <emphasis effect="italics">National Geographic, Playboy, The New Yorker</emphasis>, or <emphasis effect="italics">Better Homes and Gardens</emphasis>.</para>

      <title>EARLY DEVELOPMENTS</title>
      <para id="import-auto-id1170590732212">The word <emphasis effect="italics">magazine</emphasis> has been traced back to 1583. It comes from an Arabic word meaning storehouse or repository for goods or merchandise. By the middle of the eighteenth century the word came to denote a portable receptacle for items of value. Its first use to refer to anything resembling what we think of as a magazine today was in 1741. And this use made good sense, since a magazine publication is a portable storehouse or repository of information and entertainment.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-id7470777">Most of us today use magazine to refer to a particular type of portable repository, one in which the articles or stories by a variety of authors are relatively popular. For collections of more serious articles or less popular short fiction and poetry, we use the terms <emphasis effect="italics">journal</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">review</emphasis>. However, the lines between these various types of publications are not clear. In this chapter, all will be referred to as magazines.</para>

The first two magazines published in this country appeared in January of 1741. The <emphasis effect="italics">American Magazine</emphasis>, or <emphasis effect="italics">A Monthly View of the Political State of the British Colonies</emphasis>, lasted for three issues. <emphasis effect="italics">General Magazine</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">and Historical Chronicle, for All the British Plantations in America</emphasis> , started by Benjamin Franklin, lasted for six.

        <title>The Rise of Specialized Magazines</title>
        <para id="import-auto-id1170589791183">The publication of magazines in this country had not been going on for long before some entrepreneurs recognized that aiming at the greatest variety of people was not necessarily the most profitable tack for a publisher. They began searching for groups within the population that had identifiable specialized interests yet were large enough to ensure a respectable circulation.</para><section id="import-auto-id1170592416989">
          <title>Magazines for women.</title>
          <para id="import-auto-id1170588626964">Women were an obvious choice as one of those groups, and in 1784 a magazine designed specifically for them was published in Boston. It was titled the <emphasis effect="italics">Gentlemen and Lady's Town and Country</emphasis>. Despite the publisher's stated wish "to please rather than to wound, woman the Noblest work of God," it apparently did not please a sufficient number and died within the year. A bit of the flavor of the magazine might be sensed from the title of one of its articles, "Desultory Thoughts Upon the Utility of Encouraging a Degree of Self-Complacency, Especially in Female Bosoms." (This was undoubtedly the forerunner of articles in contemporary women's magazines on assertiveness.) Probably more typical was the sort of advice to women published in Noah Webster’s <emphasis effect="italics">American Magazine</emphasis> in March 1788:</para>

The first women's magazine was published in 1784; the first magazine for children in 1789. The latter was titled just that, <emphasis effect="italics">Children's Magazine</emphasis>. As the early women's magazines strove to educate women for their “proper” role, the children's magazines attempted the same for the young reader with such features as "Moral Tales" and "Easy Introduction to Geography." </para>

          <para id="import-auto-id1170589414461">At the beginning of the seventeenth century, scientific communication was primarily through word of mouth or through books. However, the normal book was not suitable for reporting simple observations or small experiments. Some of this information was exchanged among a small group of scholars through correspondence, but this was both inefficient and unreliable. In addition, because correspondence was personal, it did not stimulate the sort of criticism and debate essential for scholarly development. The answer was the scientific magazine or journal.</para><para id="import-auto-id6728499">The first scientific magazine was published in France in January 1655. Titled <emphasis effect="italics">Le journal des scavans (Journal of Learned Men)</emphasis>, it contained information about experiments in physics, chemistry, and anatomy and described newly invented machines and meteorological data. Two months later, a British scientific journal, <emphasis effect="italics">Philosophical Transactions</emphasis>, was published by the Council of the Royal Society. This journal is still being published today, over three hundred years later, a record no other magazine in existence can even approach. It also was the model for almost all scientific journals that followed.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-id1170589672401">Today, there are probably between thirty-five thousand and fifty thousand different scientific journals being published in the world, between six thousand and seven thousand in the United States alone.</para>

          <para id="import-auto-id1170589081070">One of the most important contributions of the early magazines in this country was the encouragement of American writers. The patriotic fervor of the Revolutionary period was shared by the editors and publishers of these magazines. Just as they wanted an American government and American laws as free as possible of European influence, they wanted American writers and an American literature—and they found and nurtured them. In this way, these fledgling magazines played a vital role in the development of a national identity in America.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-id1170590311831">Probably the magazine most successful at selling short stories to a large and heterogeneous audience was <emphasis effect="italics">The Saturday Evening Post</emphasis>.

Though humor had appeared in magazines on this continent virtually from their beginnings, it became much more prominent in this pre-Civil War period.

          <para id="import-auto-id1170589819996">During the first half of our present century the magazine became most truly a mass communication medium. This was the era of the mass circulation periodicals—<emphasis effect="italics">The Saturday Evening Post, Collier's, Life</emphasis>—magazines that appealed to a highly varied set of readers. As we shall see later in this chapter, magazines in the past few decades have become increasingly specialized; few attempt to appeal to a broad range of readers.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-id1170590401454">Until the end of the nineteenth century, magazines were essentially for the elite. Both their content and their price limited their audiences. An important revolution in the magazine industry was the development of popular publications whose content could be enjoyed by a mass audience and whose price made them affordable to that audience.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-id1170589435374">By the end of the nineteenth century, the improvements in printing technology made practical the publication of very large numbers of copies of a magazine at a low cost. At the same time, the Industrial Revolution increased the need for advertising to market mass-produced goods. With the lure of large profits to be made from advertising, magazine publishers recognized the need to win large circulations in order to demand higher advertising rates. If the magazines had to be sold for less than it cost to produce them, advertising profits could more than make up the difference.</para>

        <title>Rise of the Professional Writer</title>
        <para id="import-auto-id1170590339360">Most of the early writing in magazines was done by amateurs. Publishers had little choice, for few professional writers were around. As late as 1823 it was estimated that fewer than ten people in the entire country made their living by writing. In fact, even as late as 1842, writing could not have been a very profitable pursuit, if the claim of one editor of that period is to be believed. "The man who depends upon literature for a living," he wrote, "is little better than a fool."</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1170590000194">In spite of the economic uncertainties of the profession, by the second quarter of the nineteenth century professional writers were becoming more common. The increasingly popular magazines gave them an outlet and a source of income. That source of income was not generous at first. In the 1820s and 1830s, for example, the going rate was about $1 a Page for prose and $2 a page for poetry. Well-known writers got somewhat more; unknown writers often received nothing. Even those meager payments that professional writers were promised did not always materialize because the financial status of most magazines then was precarious.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1170589249603">Editors received comparable payment. Edgar Allen Poe's salary as assistant editor of the <emphasis effect="italics">Southern Literary Messenger</emphasis> was $10 a week. This was raised to $15 a week when he became editor-in-chief.

        <title>Political Influences</title>
        <para id="import-auto-id9044318">In the first hundred years of this country's life, a large number of magazines, like newspapers, were highly political. And a significant political theme was the abolition of slavery. As far back as 1758 magazine articles addressed that subject, both pro and con. In pre-Revolution days, the most frequent emphasis of such articles was on the suffering of slaves, but defenses of slavery were also published. In the post-Revolution period the frequency of articles opposed to slavery increased. A magazine appeared in 1820 that was devoted almost exclusively to that theme; it was called the <emphasis effect="italics">Emancipator</emphasis>. The major publishing figure in the abolition movement was Benjamin Lundy. Through the pages of the <emphasis effect="italics">Genius of Universal Emancipation</emphasis>, begun in 1821, Lundy preached the gospel of gradual abolition and colonization of black people. Most of the antislavery writing of this period grew out of religious commitments, generally Quaker, rather than out of a belief that the American Constitution applied equally to blacks and whites.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1170588223612">This attention to slavery reached its peak in the period just before and during the Civil War. <emphasis effect="italics">The Southern Literary Messenger</emphasis> urged authors to explain to the world that slavery is "a great social, moral, and political blessing." In a western magazine called the <emphasis effect="italics">Pioneer</emphasis>, readers were told that "slavery (is) authorized by God, permitted by Jesus Christ, sanctioned by the apostles, maintained by good men of all ages." By the 1850s an exceedingly large number of antislavery magazines were in print. Many of them, though by no means all, were church-related. Some antislavery magazines were also published by northern blacks. The most important of these was <emphasis effect="italics">Douglass' Monthly</emphasis>.</para><para id="import-auto-id1170588600131">The magazine publication that probably had the greatest impact on the abolitionist movement was the serialization of Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel, <emphasis effect="italics">Uncle Tom's Cabin</emphasis>, mentioned in Chapter 3. It ran in the <emphasis effect="italics">National Era</emphasis> from June 5, 1851 to April 1,1852.

The term <emphasis effect="italics">muckrake</emphasis> was adopted at this time to refer to <emphasis effect="italics">investigative journalists who search out the misconduct of prominent individuals and expose them publicly</emphasis>. Muckraker originally referred to a special rake for collecting muck or manure. It was an apt term for some of the journalists of that day. President Theodore Roosevelt is said to have been the first person to apply the term to journalists. He thought too many journalists were so busy searching for dirt they failed to see or report more important news.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1170589596864">One of the first magazines to practice muckraking in this country was McClure's. From its beginning in 1893 it had rapidly built a strong reputation by publishing fiction from the major writers of the period, such as Robert Louis Stevenson, Thomas Hardy, Stephen Crane, and O. Henry. It also ran many articles about some important personalities of the day. </para>

In one issue that year, the magazine published three articles that exposed illegal or questionable practices. One was part of a sensational history of the Standard Oil Company, one was about corruption in Minneapolis, and the third was the first part of a series on racketeering in labor unions. The issue was tremendously successful, and the publishers of the magazine realized they had found their niche in the publishing world. After this, one expose followed another. There were articles on corruption in various city governments, the copper kings of Montana, the national water Power trust, and life insurance companies.</para>

Muckraking flourished for about ten years and then, as quickly as it had developed, it died. Although muckraking articles appear occasionally in magazines and newspapers today, no major magazines are built around the serious investigation and exposure of wrongdoing by major corporations, government officials, or individuals. The closest we have to this sort of thing today are such cheap and questionable newspapers as <emphasis effect="italics">The National Enquirer</emphasis>, which focus almost totally on purported exposes of the sins and misfortunes of the famous.</para>

        <title>Advertising in Magazines</title>
        <para id="import-auto-id1170589353952">Advertising appeared in some magazines almost from the start, although it did not play an important role. In the late 1700s advertisements were occasionally found on the covers of magazines and sometimes on a page inserted between the cover and the text. By the time of the Civil War, however, advertising in magazines was quite common. Only a few publishers still considered it demeaning to have such commercial material in the pages of their magazines. These were primarily publishers of literary magazines.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1170590453288">Manufacturers of patent medicines were among the mainstays of the early advertising business. Because there was little industry or government regulation at that time, all sorts of products were advertised that we are unlikely to see in the pages of publications today. For example, in some magazines in the 1850s there were advertisements for drugs that the manufacturers claimed produced abortions. A great variety of patent medicines were regularly advertised: cancer cures, nerve tonics, and one, Vin's Electric Fluid, that promised to make cripples walk.

        <title>Magazines about Advertising</title>
        <para id="import-auto-id1170591665420">In 1851 the first magazine about advertising appeared, the predecessor of such current trade journals as <emphasis effect="italics">Advertising Age</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">Printers’ Ink</emphasis>. And even in general circulation magazines, advertising became a popular subject of analysis and comment. Writers began to warn readers about the dangers of advertising and the tricks of the trade. The following appeared in Frank Leslie's <emphasis effect="italics">lllustrated Newspaper</emphasis> in 1857:</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1170589809967"><quote id="eip-id8943213">The art of advertising is one of the arts most studied by our literary vendors of fancy soaps, philanthropic corn doctors, humanitarian pillmakers, and all the industrious professions which have an intense feeling for one's pockets. Every trick that can be resorted to for the purpose of inducing one to read an advertisement is practised, and, it must be confessed, very often with complete success. How often have we been seduced into the reading of some witty or sentimental verse, that finally led us, by slow degrees, to a knowledge that somebody sold cure-all pills or incomparable trousers.</quote></para><para id="import-auto-id1170589202902">The sort of seduction condemned by that author in 1857 continues today but receives relatively little publicity. An important part of the art of contemporary advertising is the skillful weaving together of the advertising and nonadvertising matter in a magazine in a way that maximizes the probability that readers will encounter all or most of the ads. When magazines first began to include advertising, this was not done; advertising was carefully segregated from the other content of magazines. In the spirit of the post-Civil War period, this segregation too was struck down. The leader of the movement was the Ladies' Home Journal which began interspersing parts of its stories among the advertisements, thus gently leading its readers to those important parts of its contents. Competition among magazines quickly made this a common practice.</para>

        <title>Death of the General Interest Magazines</title>
        <para id="import-auto-id1170589292639">General interest magazines survived the competition of the motion picture, the automobile, and radio, but television was too much for them. The four major mass-circulation magazines in the country were <emphasis effect="italics">Saturday Evening Post</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">Collier's</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">Life</emphasis>, and <emphasis effect="italics">Look</emphasis>. The first two provided a great variety of fiction and nonfiction, the latter two visual news and feature publications, all for the heterogeneous mass audience. Both <emphasis effect="italics">Saturday Evening Post</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">Collier's</emphasis> had clear antecedents in the early magazines of the nineteenth century. They were simply refinements of the formula, based on shrewd estimates of what the bulk of the public wanted. <emphasis effect="italics">Life</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">Look</emphasis>, on the other hand, were true innovations—the first picture magazines in this country. (The development of <emphasis effect="italics">Life</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">Look</emphasis> is discussed in the next chapter.) These general interest magazines could not compete for the general audience with that new, upstart medium—television. Even the circulation of Reader's Digest, one of the largest of any magazine in this country, is small by network television standards—"only" about 18 million. An even more serious problem than audience size was the fact that the general interest magazines could not get high enough rates for their advertising to cover the costs of their large circulations. They could not raise these rates because television was already underselling them. A network television commercial was delivering more potential viewers per advertising dollar than an ad in a major general circulation magazine could deliver. In addition, members of the television audience were more likely to pay attention to that advertising.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id2046528">To understand the competitive problem of magazines in that situation, you must realize that the print media—newspapers as well as magazines are at a disadvantage in building circulation when compared to the electronic media. Radio and television can increase audience size with little or no increase in production costs. This is not the case with magazines or newspapers. Although their cost does not double when their circulation doubles, costs for materials, printing, and delivery do increase substantially. Thus, a television network can deliver a very large audience (30 to 4O million people) to an advertiser at a far lower cost per thousand than a magazine or newspaper can.</para><para id="import-auto-id1170588193242"><emphasis effect="italics">Collier’s</emphasis> was the first general interest magazine to succumb, in 1956.

      <para id="import-auto-id1170589201939">Several factors account for the desire of American communications corporations to become larger and more global. First of all, the nature of the business is such that many of its products involve considerable risk on the part of the producer. A new magazine, a new movie, or a new television program may or may not win audience or advertiser approval. so corporations want to be large enough to absorb ventures that fail or require a great deal of risk. Time, Inc., for example, invested 47 million in TV-Cable Week, a magazine that lasted less than six months. Rupert Murdoch lost some $260 million in the first year of operation of Sky Television, a four-channel direct-to-homes satellite network.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1170590187505">Another factor that has enabled communications corporations to spread their tentacles is the development of fiber optics and satellite technology, which have made it easier and less expensive to distribute information.

          <para id="import-auto-id1170590652786">One major reason for the greater specialization of magazines these days is advertising. Magazines have become more specialized not only because the general interest publication could not deliver a large audience to advertisers for as low a cost per thousand as television could, but also because many advertisers have come to realize they neither need nor want a general audience. By pinpointing their potential customers, companies can reduce advertising costs because they are not paying for readers who can do them no good. In other words, if you are selling camping equipment, why should you pay for readers who never go camping? That is precisely what you must do, though, if you advertise in a general interest magazine. On the other hand, when you advertise in a camping or hunting magazine, you are getting more relevant readers for each dollar you invest. The same is true whether you are advertising lingerie, pipe tobacco, Rolls Royces, or a laundry detergent. Obviously, there are some products for which almost anyone is a potential purchaser. Most products, though, are bought largely by particular types of persons, and advertisers want to place their messages in the magazines where almost every reader will be one of those types. And that magazine is the specialized one.</para><para id="import-auto-id1170592876745">Companies obviously find magazine advertising worthwhile, for they are doing a great deal of it. Examine your favorite magazines, and you will probably find that, on the average, almost half the space is devoted to advertising. This percentage has remained surprisingly stable over the past few decades, ranging between about 45 and 50 percent. Though magazines vary a great deal in this respect, some carrying far more advertising than editorial copy, others carrying a far greater percentage of editorial copy, on the average, that 50:50 ratio seems to hold.</para>

          <para id="import-auto-id1170589171914">The cost of advertising in magazines today is generally based on a periodical's circulation, the particular kinds of readers that it has, the size of the ad, its use of color or black and white, and the frequency with which the advertiser agrees to buy space. Sometimes renewal discounts are available when an advertiser agrees to continue buying at least as much advertising space for a second, third, or fourth year. Some magazines also charge different rates for advertising in different sections. For example, the inside front cover and the back of a magazine often bring premium prices. Publishers who own a group of magazines may offer a special discount to advertisers who buy space in more than one.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-id1170589929773">Advertising rates depend in large part on circulation, and when advertising became important, the need arose for reliable circulation figures.

The difference in price was more than made up for in advertising revenue. In fact, the total revenue of some magazines today comes from advertising, and copies are distributed without charge. These are usually highly specialized publications, distributed to readers with a high probability of buying the advertised products. For example, a number of medical journals distributed free to doctors contain primarily advertising of medicines and medical equipment. Also, some magazines about closed circuit television are distributed free to users of such equipment.

One of the most obvious examples of this was the campaign some magazines waged in the 1940s for repeal of the federal government's tax on cosmetics. All of the magazines involved in the campaign were magazines that depend on advertising by cosmetic manufacturers.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-id1170590300368">This sort of influence is obvious. What is not so obvious is the degree to which magazines have refrained from using material that some of their advertisers might disapprove of: articles on the dangers of some products such as cigarettes, on the tax breaks of some industries, on questionable union-busting tactics, and so on. Not all editors and publishers have succumbed to pressures to include or exclude materials, but such principled behavior has sometimes resulted in lost advertising.</para>

Roughly 20 percent of those published in the United States today are weeklies, while 6 percent come out twice a month, 42 percent once a month, 11 percent every two months, and 12 percent every three months.

Most of these, however, are trade publications or company publications for employees and customers, and you are not likely to find them in your mosaic.

A friend may pass a few on to you occasionally. Some you may buy on impulse, because you liked the cover or were browsing through a copy on the newsstand and saw something you wanted to read. You almost certainly glance through magazines when you are waiting in your dentist's or doctor's office or while on an airplane. You may even browse through a magazine or two occasionally when you are waiting for someone in the library or at a friend's home.

        <title>The Magazine Audience </title>
        <para id="import-auto-id1170590101363">There are no reliable estimates of the number of people in the United States who read magazines or the average amount of magazine reading they do. We do know, however, that if you consider a single issue of all of the different magazines published in this country, approximately one-and-a-half copies are sold for every adult in the population. We also know, as mentioned in different contexts before, that the average magazine is read by between two and four persons. Thus, quite a bit of magazine reading appears to be going on in the United States. However, this reading is not spread evenly among American adults. Some read many magazines, while others read none at all.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1170588161444">Our data on the kinds of people who are more likely to read magazines are better than our data on the number who do. Surveys show, not surprisingly, that the amount of magazine reading is highly correlated with education. The more educated people are, the more time they are likely to spend reading magazines. We also know that women tend to read magazines more than men do. This is shown by various kinds of data, including the fact that magazines that appeal primarily to women outsell magazines that appeal primarily to men. It may seem strange or out of date to you for anyone in the 1990s to be talking about men's magazines or women's magazines. However, there is little evidence that the sexual revolution is erasing the clear distinctions between men's and women's tastes in magazines. Men are more likely than women to read magazines that cover news on business and finance, mechanics and science, sports, outdoor life, and those that include photographs of women in various states of undress. Men also have a higher probability of reading the general news magazines. Women, on the other hand, are more likely to read magazines with useful household information (recipes, home décor, child care, and gardening) or fashion and beauty information.</para>

There is obviously no simple answer to that question, but one important reason is that they want a different kind of material than is readily available elsewhere or they want more of a certain kind of material than they can find in newspapers or the electronic media. Special interests or desires for detailed coverage of a specialized area apparently are not being served adequately by these other media.</para></section>

          <para id="import-auto-id1170589080937">When the postal service was established, no one thought of it as a means of delivering magazines or newspapers, so these media were not even mentioned in the laws governing that service. As a result, whether magazines could be sent by mail was left to the discretion of each local postmaster. Since some of these postmasters also ran small publishing businesses on the side, they were not uninterested participants. Most of them agreed to deliver magazines but, because there was no law to guide them, the arrangements for such delivery were quite varied. Some delivered magazines without charge. Others insisted that whoever wanted to receive a magazine through the mail must pay a fee. In some cases the fee went to the postmaster, in other cases to the horseman who delivered the mail.</para><para id="import-auto-id1170590432908">ln 1794, the United States Congress finally amended the postal regulations to legalize the mailing of magazines. However, that amendment made clear that the delivery of magazines was not the primary function of the postal service; the regulation specified that magazines could be delivered "when the mode of conveyance and the size of the mails will permit it."</para>
          <para id="import-auto-id1170590763850">From this first amendment, our postal laws have recognized the importance of magazines, as well as newspapers and books, to our country and our people. These publications have always been helped by favorable postal laws that permitted them to be sent through the mails much more cheaply than most other sorts of material. In a sense, this was a subsidy that encouraged and made possible the publication of many magazines. This "subsidy" has been sharply reduced in recent years; Postal charges for printed matter have risen considerably.</para>

Should we ask individuals to pay more for their personal letters and businesses to pay more for their correspondences so that magazines and newspapers can get lower postal rates? Should we insist that individuals and nonmedia businesses pay higher taxes so that the mass media businesses can be permitted to pay less?

Annual or multiyear subscriptions give the publisher a somewhat more dependable circulation. At least as important, subscribers pay in advance, which helps the company's cash position. Getting subscribers to renew their subscriptions is relatively easy, far easier than finding new subscribers. The bookkeeping is also easier for the renewal than the new subscription. This is the reason publishers are so persistent when your payment for renewal fails to come in on time and they fear you may be planning to drop your subscription.</para><para id="import-auto-id1170591010506">Many commercial agencies help publishers with their magazine subscriptions.

You can see signs of this trend in the growing number of magazines with attention-catching covers. Such covers are not a new phenomenon, of course. The warm and attractive human scenes painted by Norman Rockwell for the covers of the old weekly <emphasis effect="italics">Saturday Evening Post</emphasis> have become classics. <emphasis effect="italics">Time</emphasis> magazine's people covers, featuring the man or woman of the week or year, have been attracting attention to each new issue for generations.

It must stand out from that mass of color, pictures, and design. For this reason, an attention-gaining cover is crucial. Another important factor in selling magazines through newsstands is getting prime display space on those stands. This is similar to the competition among different producers of canned and packaged foods to get good display space on supermarket shelves. With so much competition, and so little difference among some of the products, distributors want the eyes of the potential customer to fall on their product first.

        <para id="import-auto-id1170589068385">A relatively new problem facing the magazine industry is the decline in the number of dishibutors. Fifteen years ago there were 13 major national distributors—companies that convince merchants to stock their racks with the magazines they represent and then arrange for their delivery. Today there are only 5, and 2 of these may be joined as a result of the Time-Warner merger. Where have all the distributors gone? Some were swallowed up in the merger fever that has affected other aspects of the magazine industry; others went bankrupt. Murdoch Magazines, for example, became a maior distributor when it purchased Triangle Publications, which had its own distribution division. Until then Murdoch had used Select Magazines as its distributor. Having already lost the <emphasis effect="italics">McCall's</emphasis> account as a result of a ioint venture between the owner of McCall's and Time, Inc., Select Magazines—the only major independent distributor—was forced into bankruptcy when it lost Murdoch as well.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1170590452523">Although sales from newsstands account for only 24 percent of the total circulation revenues of consumer magazines, publishers rely on such outlets to introduce their products to potential customers. Also, the rising cost of using the postal service makes shoppers with money in hand more attractive than subscribers, who often receive their magazines at considerably less than the cover price.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1721081">The main concern among small publishers is that the large distribution companies, which are owned by giant publishing corporations, will provide better representation and placement for the magazines they publish. An attorney for Select Magazines put it this way: "lf you have a magazine that competes with one published by Hearst, and if Hearst is distributing yours along with two hundred others, it doesn't take much imagination to figure out where the sales force that works for Hearst will spend its energy."</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1170589028643"><emphasis effect="bold">REVIEW |</emphasis> Since magazines are often dishibuted through the mail, postal rates greatly affect the cost of distribution.

That type of vertical integration prevented many independent producers from having their movies shown in theaters owned by the major Hollywood studios. Eventually, government action forced the studios to sell their theaters (Chapter 7). Do you think similar action might be necessary to preserve competition among magazine publishers?

      <title>FUNCTIONS AND EFFECTS OF MAGAZINES</title>

        <title>Functions</title>
        <para id="import-auto-id1170589247051">Before the days of network radio and television, magazines—and, to a lesser extent, books—provided a common base of information and ideas to the educated elite of our country. Unlike most other countries, until fairly recent times we had no major national newspapers that served this function. Today, with their national editions, as we noted in Chapter 4, <emphasis effect="italics">The Wall Street Journal</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">New York Times</emphasis> have assumed that role, but they continue to be supplemented by <emphasis effect="italics">Time</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">Newsweek</emphasis>. (Although there is a national newspaper, <emphasis effect="italics">USA Today</emphasis>, that is not influential in this way.)</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1170589079149">In the early part of this century, magazines also provided Americans with most of their light fiction, much of it very good. To a large extent, television and the paperback have replaced the magazine as supplier of light fiction. However, neither television nor the paperback provides an adequate source for the imaginative short story, the type of fiction that was developed so superbly in some magazines. As a result, the short story form is in danger.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1170590575922">Another and related function served by magazines prior to the rise of the paperback novel was the nurturance of young writers who were attempting to establish their reputations. Magazines provided the only possible outlet for most of these writers. Authors gained experience and established their names and then were able to move into book publication. In addition, during the late 1800s especially, many books were first serialized in a magazine and then published as a single work in hardcover. The magazine provided a type of test market to see whether a work would be sufficiently popular to justify book publication.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1170589549240">Writers such as ]ohn Greenleaf Whittier, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Mark Twain, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow depended on magazines for an outlet. Many of their important works first appeared in these publications. A young fiction writer today has no comparable outlet. The paperback is the closest approximation, but it is far more difficult for an unknown writer to get a story accepted for paperback publication than it was to get one accepied by a magazine publisher prior to World War II, when short stories and serials were important features in many magazines.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1170589984598">The small-circulation magazine, the "little magazine," plays an important function in our society, even today. More than any of the other media, it is the nurturer of new ideas. As one former magazine editor put it, "Because new ideas . . . do not always or usually attract large audiences, a diversity of small-circulation media is needed to insure their expression." Being in print, in the types of magazines retained by libraries, new ideas can be passed from mind to mind over an extended period of time. The little magazines serve as seedbeds in which ideas can take root and gain strength before being set out where they must face the harsh elements.</para><para id="import-auto-id1170589399103">The more popular ideas, those in which there is more immediate interest, can be found in a variety of magazines devoted to commentary on contemporary affairs and, especially, controversial issues. These magazines, such as <emphasis effect="italics">The Nation, National Review, The New Republic, Progressive Commentary</emphasis>, and <emphasis effect="italics">Mother Jones</emphasis>, represent a wide range of political ideologies. If you want to know where the political left or the political right or some other politically identifiable group stands on the major issues of the day, the appropriate magazines are probably your most reliable source.</para>

New Journalism, in which the reporters are important parts of their own stories and which capitalizes on rather than suppresses the writers' subiective reactions to events, began in the magazines. Writers of fiction, such as Norman Mailer, Truman Capote, and Tom Wolfe, created a new type of writing—a hybrid of journalism and fiction—that helped shatter the once-sacred journalistic ideal of "objectivity." Although newspaper journalists have not carried this style to the extremes that some writers have in magazines, the reporting style of many has moved in that direction.</para>

This is already being done with the advertising content of some magazines when advertisers want to target different regions. Such technology also makes it possible not only for magazines to provide specialized information to readers, as they are now doing, but for one magazine to provide specialized sections that go only to particular groups of subscribers. This seems the next logical step in the continuing trend toward greater and greater specialization in all of the mass media.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1170590712457">It is difficult to predict the future impact on magazines of cable television's ability to deliver printed information on demand through the video scrieen. If cable affects any magazines, it is most likely to be the trade magazines. Information useful to specialists in the various professions will be more profitable to program into the cable system and, equally important, those people with an economic motive for reading magazines are more likely to exert the extra effort required to get their information in this new way. The McGraw-Hill publishing firm has been preparing for some time for this shift in the method of delivering the kinds of information now transmitted by trade journals and specialized newsletters. The entire company has been reorganized to emphasize the electronic marketing of information, which companies, educational institutions, and various professionals will be able to receive—for a fee—through telephone lines to their personal computers. McGraw-Hill president Joseph Dionne predicts that, within the next decade, at least half the company's revenues will be coming from such electronic sale and delivery of information.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1170592455935">Despite cable television, the shortage of wood pulp for making paper, and all the other factors that have led some people to predict the end of magazines as we know them today, magazines will survive. There may be fewer than there are today, but their combination of relative permanence, portability, and types of content they are capable of delivering will keep some of us buying them. If your professional goal is a job on the staff of a magazine, or even to start your own magazine, do not be dissuaded by the prophets of doom.<sup>3</sup></para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1170589015477"><emphasis effect="bold">REVIEW |</emphasis> Magazines affect our lifestyles, attitudes, and ways of doing business. They even affect other media. They also provide support for those whose lives are in the process of change. In the future magazines are likely to become even more specialized as publishers develop new ways of producing and transmitting information.</para>

      <title>THE SPECIALIZATION OF MAGAZINES: A SUMMARY</title>
      <para id="import-auto-id1170590153219">As we have seen in this chapter, the major trend in magazines during this century has been their gradual change from general interest publication, which appealed to a broad segment of the population, to highly specialized publications, each appealing to a relatively narrow or homogeneous group. Magazines will continue to provide something for everyone, but in different magazines rather than in the same one. As printing technology improves even more, the day may soon arrive when you can order almost any kind of print and pictorial material in a unique magazine tailored to your special interest.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1170588593606">A major problem that will remain, however, is distribution. Rising postal rates are making it less practical to distribute magazines by mail. Publishers, therefore, are depending more on over-the-counter sales, although this distribution system does not provide the dependable circulation from week to week or month to month that subscriptions do.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1170588504231">Increased dependence on over-the-counter sales also has some side effects. One is to make the magazine's appearance more critical, since it must compete with the large number of other magazines on the racks in attracting the attention of potential purchasers.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1170590165730">The increased specialization of magazines means you are less likely to find something that interests you when you flip through the pages of a random assortment of magazines. You must search more systematically for the type of magazine you want, just as magazine publishers must work more systematically to design the content, layout, and delivery system of their magazines for their particular target audiences.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1170590503846">Although magazines no longer serve as primary breeding grounds for hopeful young writers of fiction, they still serve many other important functions. To some extent, they provide a common base of knowledge to individuals with similar concerns who are scattered throughout this vast country. More than any other medium of communication, magazines are the testing grounds and nurturers of new ideas. If you want to know what the leading business leaders or political scientists, or the far right or left, are thinking today, you are most likely to find their thoughts in the magazines that are targeted for each of those specific groups.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1170589189162">Magazines thus shape the thinking of many of us, as we learn what our peers and would-be peers around the country are saying. They also shape many of our behaviors as we buy and read those magazines that can provide ideas on nudist colonies and homemaking, farming and jogging, camping and politics. Whatever your needs and interests, there are magazines to serve them.</para>
