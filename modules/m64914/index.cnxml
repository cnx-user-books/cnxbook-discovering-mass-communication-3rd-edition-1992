Just as clearly, the second most important advance was radio. With this development, vast multitudes of people throughout the world for the first time were brought into the mass communication audience. The print medium requires an audience to be able to read; radio is a medium that demands no special skill from its audience, requires little if any payment beyond the small initial investment in a receiver, and reaches listeners over a vast area. For these reasons, the medium of radio continues to be used for educational and propaganda purposes in all underdeveloped parts of the world today and for information and entertainment everywhere in the world.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm951837120">Radio today does more than simply penetrate our homes; it follows us. Portable radios and car radios have made it the most pervasive of all media. The average household has between five and six radio receivers, and almost all cars (95 percent) are now equipped with radios. The average American over the age of 12 spends more than three hours a day with the radio. During the course of any given week, radio reaches nearly all teenagers in the country. We listen to the radio while lying on the beach or negotiating rush-hour traffic, while eating breakfast or cramming for an exam. Your mail carrier probably carries a radio on delivery rounds. Joggers and roller skaters move to the rhythms of their favorite stations. Some sports enthusiasts even bring their radios to the stadium so they can supplement their first-hand view with an expert account of the game. In few places today can you escape the sounds of radio.</para>

      <title>THE BEGINNINGS OF RADIO</title>
      <para id="import-auto-idm1053883616">To understand the operation of radio and television today, and especially the reasons for some of our present practices, it is important to consider some highlights in the history of radio.<sup>1</sup> The roots of radio, like those of the other mass communications media, are many and varied. One important root is the electric telegraph, conceived by American artist and inventor Samuel Morse in 1832 and successfully demonstrated to Congress in 1844. The electric telegraph was rather simple in theory; it demanded only a wire carrying an electric current between two points and a system for periodically making and breaking an electric circuit in order to send a series of dots and dashes (short and long bursts of current) through the wire.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm371381264"><figure id="import-auto-idm1300569840"><media id="import-auto-idm363166288" alt=""><image mime-type="image/png" src="../../media/Picture 26.png" height="753" width="576"/></media></figure>[Radio History Timeline]</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm1049405440">Another important root of radio is the telephone, first demonstrated by Alexander Graham Bell in 1876. Within a year, this device so stirred the imaginations of people that a few foresaw a time when one could speak or play music into one end of the telephone and be heard by audiences long distances away, connected only by the telephone line. And there were demonstrations of concerts in one city heard through telephone connections by audiences in other cities. But the need for a connecting line was a major hurdle to. the development of the telephone as a radio system.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm967356656">During the latter part of the nineteenth century, most people were not interested in using the telephone for mass communication; they did not perceive the potential importance of such use. They were far more concerned with freeing the telegraph from the need for wires because they thought it could then be more useful for business and for the safety of ships at sea. For these purposes, efforts were made to develop a wireless, a telegraph system that did not require connecting lines between the sender and the receiver.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm1318232752">The first workable wireless telegraph system was developed by a young Italian, Guglielmo Marconi, late in the nineteenth century. When Italian authorities showed no interest in his invention, he and his Irish mother took it to Great Britain, where its value was quickly recognized. He patented his wireless system in England in 1897 and found financing to establish Marconi's Wireless Telegraph Company. As Marconi continued his experiments, wireless telegraph systems were installed in lighthouses and aboard naval vessels. More important to the future of mass communication, the "wireless" was first used to speed the transmission of news in 1899. A steamship was fitted with wireless so that it could follow the yachts racing in a regatta and telegraph the details to a shore station, from where they could be phoned to newspapers. The results of the race were published even before the ships returned to land. During that same year, the Marconi Wireless Company of America was incorporated, and the use of the new wireless technology began to spread.</para>
      <section id="import-auto-idm370044320">
        <title>From Wireless to Radio</title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm320877648">News of the wireless telegraph stimulated renewed efforts by those who dreamed of music and speech being transmitted over long distances without wires. The first of these to achieve a true realization of the dream was Reginald Fessenden. He did it by radically changing the transmission system developed by Marconi. Marconi's system depended on periodic transmissions of an electromagnetic wave, or short and long interruptions of the wave to signal the dots and dashes of the Morse code. Fessenden instead sent a continuous wave and modulated its amplitude by superimposing on it another wave created by sound, either a voice or music picked up by a type of telephone.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm976357904">An Iowan named Lee de Forest and an Englishman named John Fleming advanced modern radio a step further. One of the weakest aspects of the wireless telephone at the beginning of the twentieth century was the technology for receiving and amplifying the sound that came over the air. In 1905, building on the idea of a glass bulb detector invented by Fleming, de Forest developed a radio vacuum tube he called the Audion. It was an extremely effective detector and amplifier of radio waves. Useful for both sending and receiving radio signals, the Audion was a key element in the development of radio broadcasting and much of the rest of our modern electronics industry.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm990842576"><figure id="import-auto-idm1182466784"><media id="import-auto-idm1176402592" alt=""><image mime-type="image/png" src="../../media/Picture 27.png" height="594" width="576"/></media></figure>[Picture: Marconi 1899 visit to United States to demonstrate wireless telegraphy; Caption: In 1899 Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi traveled to the United States to demonstrate his wireless telegraphy apparatus. The occasion was the America Cup yacht race, and Marconi's reporting of the race for the New York Herald and Evening Telegram established the practical value of radio communication. Here Marconi is shown sending the first wireless marine message in America.]</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1040452672">In order to gain publicity and support for his ventures, de Forest and his wife spent a night broadcasting music atop the Eiffel Tower in Paris. This broadcast was picked up by listeners within a 500-mile radius of Paris and generated much excitement about the new medium.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1184146976">An interesting sidelight on these early broadcasting ventures of de Forest's is the fact that he was responsible for the first broadcast on behalf of women's rights. In 1908, he broadcast a speech by his mother-in-law advocating women's suffrage. This occurred 12 years before the ratification of the constitutional amendment that granted women the right to vote.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm944370416">Like many of the pioneers in mass communication, de Forest was a visionary. He saw radio as a medium that could educate and uplift its audience. As part of his campaign to realize his vision, he broadcast operas from the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City as early as 1916. That same year he also installed a special line from the editorial office of the New York <emphasis effect="italics">American</emphasis> and broadcast the presidential election returns.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1044519232">Lee de Forest was motivated by more than the desire to uplift and educate when he began regular broadcasts in New York City. He also wanted to advertise his equipment to radio amateurs and give them broadcasts that would make worthwhile the construction of a receiver. A number of the other early broadcasters were similarly motivated, and they were successful. Not only did many amateurs build receivers; they built transmitters as well. In 1913, about a thousand radio transmitters were operating in the United States. By 1917, when the United States entered World War I, close to nine thousand were operating. All were either shut down or taken over by the armed forces when the United States declared war on Germany.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1188916240"><emphasis effect="bold">REVIEW |</emphasis> Radio operates on the same principle as the telegraph and telephone but without the wires. The Italian Guglielmo Marconi and Americans Reginald Fessenden and Lee de Forest played key roles in the development of radio transmission and reception components.</para>

        <title>World War I Spurs Radio Developments</title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm940529776">The need of the armed forces for dependable communications equipment during World War I hastened many technological developments. This occurred partly through mobilization of the expertise and partly through getting different companies to work together for the period of the war, setting aside the competitive tactics that had sometimes slowed development. Among other things, the needs of the armed forces demanded that the companies cooperate to standardize on key aspects of equipment so that parts could be interchangeable. The American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T), General Electric, Westinghouse, and American Marconi all worked together for an American war victory. Radio was also a winner in the effort.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm356689696">The ancestor of Voice of America, this country's current international broadcasting arm, was born during the war. The Navy took over a powerful transmitter at New Brunswick, New Jersey, and used it for wireless communication to American forces and foreign receivers throughout the world. In 1918, it transmitted directly to the German people President Wilson's appeal for peace.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1028573120">Out of the experience of World War I came another development that had an even greater impact on broadcasting in America. The Navy had come to believe that a technology so valuable as radio should remain in government hands. Navy officials, along with some of the leaders in General Electric, were also afraid that the British-dominated Marconi company might win control of world communications. While proponents of a Navy controlled monopoly of radio failed to persuade Congress to enact legislation that would have placed radio permanently in government hands, Navy officials and General Electric president Owen D. Young managed to engineer the formation of the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) in 1919 and turned over to this new corporation all of American Marconi's wireless stations that were being held by the government. With the support of AT&amp;T and General Electric, RCA soon dominated communications in this country and abroad. Continued American control of the company was made certain by RCA's articles of incorporation, which stated that at least 80 percent of its stock must be held by United States citizens and that all directors and officers must be citizens.</para>

        <title>The Early Stations </title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm975004528">One important early amateur broadcaster in America was Frank Conrad, a self-educated engineer and inventor at the Westinghouse Electric Company. From a laboratory in his garage, he broadcast recorded music and talked with other radio amateurs around the country. Conrad's call letters were 8XK. A local music store furnished records for him in 'exchange for acknowledgments on the air. After World War I, with the help of his sons and friends, Conrad began a regular broadcast schedule. Every Saturday evening, for example, he broadcast a concert of records. In 1920, he broadcast a "remote": It was a piano solo performed in the house by one of his sons and carried to the garage by wire.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1024344736"><emphasis effect="bold">REVIEW |</emphasis> World War I resulted in many technological developments in radio and the formation of the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), formerly known as American Marconi. In 1920, Frank Conrad, an engineer for Westinghouse, helped establish KDKA, a station still on the air.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1040738512">The development of broadcasting received a large boost one day in September 1920 when a department store in Pittsburgh advertised wireless receivers for sale with which people could hear Conrad's broadcasts. The receivers sold for $10. A vice president of the Westinghouse Corporation, realizing the commercial possibilities, instructed Conrad to build a more powerful transmitter to be placed on one of the Westinghouse buildings. It was to be used for regular radio broadcasts that presumably would stimulate the sale of Westinghouse parts for making simple radio receivers.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1034851600">The first major broadcast from that transmitter was the election-night coverage of the presidential race between Warren G. Harding and James M. Cox. The call letters of the Pittsburgh station were <emphasis effect="italics">KDKA</emphasis>. This station is still the major hub in the Westinghouse broadcast group.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1037175872">At first, KDKA was on the air just one hour a night, but gradually the hours of broadcast lengthened. The success of its station in Pittsburgh also encouraged the Westinghouse Company to construct similar stations in Newark, Chicago, and Springfield, Massachusetts, and the sale of Westinghouse receiver parts boomed.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1023510800">In 1921, stirred by the success of KDKA, RCA moved on two fronts: It began to mass-produce home radio receivers and put its first radio station on the air. Helping to manage these developments was a young man named David Sarnoff.</para>

        <title>David Sarnoff</title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1047080240">David Sarnoff, who had migrated to America from Russia when he was nine years old, came to public attention in this country in April of 1912, while he was a Marconi telegraph operator at a demonstration station in the Wanamaker department store in New York City. He was the telegraph operator who caught the faint SOS signals from the <emphasis effect="italics">S.S. Titanic</emphasis>, which had hit an iceberg far out in the Atlantic and was sinking. Sarnoff stayed at his telegraph key for 72 hours, relaying messages to other ships that might save survivors. He was also the source of information for American newspapers and for the relatives and friends of survivors. President Taft had ordered all other wireless stations in the country off the air so that there would be no interference. At the age of 21, David Sarnoff was a national hero. At the American Marconi Company, and later at RCA, he became a key figure.</para>

        <title>Educational Stations </title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm324674064">Experimental stations were developed in the earliest days of radio by a number of universities in the Midwest, primarily by professors of electrical engineering or physics. Initially these were wireless stations; later they became broadcasting stations for voice and music. Even before World War I, educational stations were operating at Nebraska Wesleyan University, the University of North Dakota, and at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. Many of their early broadcasts were designed to serve farmers with weather reports, market reports, and news highlights. The University of Wisconsin station was apparently the first to be officially licensed, in 1914.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm987587168">By 1927 licenses had been issued to 94 educational institutions. However, the stock market crash of 1929 shook the economic stability of educational as well as business institutions, and by early 1931 that number had dropped to 49; by 1946 there were only 29. Another factor in that drop was the lack of interest in radio on the part of educational administrators. In addition, once radio was beyond the experimental stage, many professors of physics and electrical engineering lost interest, and there was no one else to pick up the reins.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm369911808">During this period, noncommercial radio had its advocates, but they were no match for commercial interests. All efforts in the 1930s to reserve a small portion of the radio frequencies for educational and other nonprofit organizations were beaten back by the commercial lobby. Not only were efforts to expand noncommercial broadcasting in America defeated; educational stations already on the air were far from secure. Commercial interests tried, sometimes successfully, to take away many of their licenses. Nebraska Wesleyan station WCAJ was forced off the air by WOW in Omaha; University of Arkansas station KUOA was pressured into selling out to a commercial firm. And there were others: Of the 202 licenses held by educational institutions between 1921 and 1936, 164 were taken over by commercial interests or were allowed to lapse.<sup>2</sup></para><para id="import-auto-idm1168324400"><emphasis effect="bold">REVIEW |</emphasis> Educational stations flourished for a while but declined in number after the stock market crash of 1929.</para></section>

        <title>Government Regulation of Broadcasting</title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm352191248">The need for some sort of regulation surfaced early in the development of wireless communication. The impetus came initially from the United States Navy in the early 1900s. The Navy was concerned about increasing interference with critical ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore communication by amateur wireless operators. The result was a licensing law passed in 1912. This law, designed to regulate wireless telegraphy, also affected radio broadcasting as the wireless technology began to be used for voice and music transmission.</para>

        <title>The Radio Act of 1912 </title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm2077892336">The radio licensing law of 1912 was simple. It required a wireless operator to obtain a permit from the secretary of commerce and each transmitter to be supervised by someone who had passed a special licensing examination. The Radio Act of 1912 gave the secretary of commerce authority to designate the wavelength on which a permit holder could transmit and the hours of such transmission, so that interference could be controlled. The secretary could not refuse a permit. The law also gave the president the power to shut down transmitters in time of war.</para>

      <section id="import-auto-idm973276880">
        <title>The Radio Act of 1927 </title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm381126448">The 1912 act worked well until the post-World War I period. But as the number of radio stations jumped from 8 to 576 between 1921 and 1923, interference became impossible to control. That fact made many broadcasters eager to have more government regulation because they wanted to reduce the chaos on the air. Another factor that helped bring about regulation was the strong conservationist spirit in America at this time. Many persons were upset by the plundering of this country's oil and other natural resources for private gain. When the Radio Act of 1927 was enacted, it was strongly influenced by one of the leading conservationists in the Congress, Nebraska Senator George W. Norris. At the urging of Norris and others of like mind, the new act made clear that radio frequencies belong to the public, not to the <emphasis effect="bold">licensee </emphasis><emphasis effect="italics">(the individual or group that owns a broadcasting station)</emphasis>. The act specified that anyone granted a broadcasting license had the use of a particular frequency for a limited number of years. In addition, the act stated that each station must operate "<emphasis effect="bold">in the public interest, convenience, or necessity.</emphasis>"</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm356950656">That phrase, "the public interest, convenience, or necessity," <emphasis effect="italics">appears throughout the act and has been a key factor in the regulation of American broadcasting </emphasis>ever since it was used in the Radio Act of 1927. Its interpretation has also been a source of some argument. Broadcasters, regulators, attorneys, scholars, consumer advocates, and others have argued whether the "public interest" means that which interests the public or that which someone decides is good for the public. And if it means the latter, who should make that decision? The argument, which began in 1927, is still far from settled.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm345384848">The other important new element in the Radio Act of 1927 was the principle of the independent regulatory commission. The idea was that the commissioners, although appointed by the president of the United States and approved by the Senate, were to have relatively long terms so that they could be independent of political pressures.</para>

        <title>The Communications Act of 1934</title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm953373920">The Radio Act of 1927 was superseded during the early years of Franklin Roosevelt's administration by the Communications Act of 1934, but the new act retained all the important features of its predecessor:</para>

        </list>
        <para id="import-auto-idm343027632">The last feature, usually called the <emphasis effect="bold">equal time provision</emphasis>, stated that <emphasis effect="italics">if one candidate for public office is sold or given time on a radio station during a political campaign, all other bona fide candidates for that office must be afforded the same opportunity</emphasis>.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm999868256">Since 1934, many attempts have been made to overhaul the Communications Act, but it remains essentially unchanged. One of the few relatively major changes was to extend the period of a broadcast license from three to five years for television and three to seven years for radio.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm2095720688">Although the Communications Act calls for equal opportunities for all candidates for an office, Congress decided in 1959 to exempt certain kinds of news broadcasts from this rule. They exempted bona fide newscasts, bona fide news interviews, news documentaries (if the appearance of a candidate is incidental to the presentation of the subjects covered by the news documentaries), and on-the-spot coverage of bona fide news events. These exemptions make it possible for stations to give news coverage to the major candidates without being forced to give equivalent treatment to all minor party candidates who have little chance for election.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm332159536">This revision in the equal time provision provided the loophole that has made possible the broadcasting of debates between major party candidates for the presidency without giving the same sort of opportunity to the many minor party candidates in the race. Broadcasters claim that the debates are bona fide news events and that they are simply doing on-thespot coverage of these events, even though they are often the instructors and stagers of the debates.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1182833328">Since the exemptions to the equal time provision became law in 1959, a great many debates have been broadcast between major party candidates for state, local, and national offices.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm376886240">Many arguments have been offered for and against these exemptions. Broadcasters claim they make it possible to give better coverage to the candidates in an election who have a chance of being elected. If stations must provide equal time for the candidates of the many minor parties, such coverage would be impossible. In recent presidential elections, for example, there were candidates not only from the Democratic and Republican parties but also from the Prohibition Party, the Socialist Party, and the States' Rights Party, to name only a few. There was one candidate for the presidency recently whose only goal was to remove "shyster lawyers" from government posts and another whose plan for eliminating crime was to give every citizen a "Saturday Night Special." The argument against loopholes in the equal time provision is that, without decent broadcast coverage of nontraditional candidates, it is more difficult to get fresh ideas into America's political discourse.</para>

        <title>The Deregulation Debate </title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1021017808">If history is a reliable guide, we can expect to hear more in the years ahead about whether the equal time provision and other regulations should be strengthened or eliminated. In fact, we are almost certain to hear a great deal of debate over <emphasis effect="bold">deregulation</emphasis>—<emphasis effect="italics">the elimination of all regulation of radio and television, except for the control of technical standards and interference</emphasis>. The major argument for such deregulation is that now with more than ten thousand radio and television stations on the air, as well as a variety of cable channels, VCRs, and computerized data banks, competition alone—the marketplace—ensures that the public interest, convenience, and necessity will be adequately served. Opponents of broadcast regulation also argue that the costs of compliance are too high, that regulation is slowing the growth of important and valuable communication industries, and that it is contrary to the First Amendment's freedom of speech and press provision. They claim the media have difficulty fulfilling their traditional function in this country of being watchdogs of government when they are subject to regulation by that government. A recent head of the Federal Communications Commission even argued that "as long as you've got government control, there is the potential that those in authority, with that power of censorship, can use it for evil means."</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm355580992">Proponents of regulation, on the other hand, argue that in today's world the public has less to fear from government than from advertisers and communication industries, whose only serious concern is maximizing profits. They assert that the marketplace will not ensure adequate coverage of the major sides of all important controversial issues or the broadcasting of useful materials to segments of the audience with whom advertisers have little desire to communicate: young children, the poor, the aged, and groups with unpopular views or interests. In addition, they point out that the broadcast spectrum, like our national parks, forests, lakes, and rivers, is a public resource and ought to be protected and regulated in a way that best serves the public interest. Just as the unregulated cutting of timber in national forests can destroy those precious resources, so the unregulated use of the broadcasting spectrum for profit alone can destroy its capacity to serve society.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1935294080">The Federal Communications Commission has already eliminated a great deal of broadcasting regulation. Radio, especially, is almost totally free of it. Radio stations no longer need to base their programming on systematic studies of the needs of their communities. They no longer need to keep program logs that are open to the public; to limit advertising; to provide any news, public affairs, or local programming; or to present detailed reports to the FCC to demonstrate that they have served the public interest, convenience, or necessity. The FCC recommendations to both radio and television stations regarding children's programs have been eliminated. The duration of operating licenses has been extended, and the number of stations an individual or corporation can own has been increased. Many other regulations are also slated for softening or elimination. </para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1043800016">Perhaps the most hotly debated regulation has been the <emphasis effect="bold">Fairness Doctrine</emphasis>, which <emphasis effect="italics">required broadcasters to seek out and present opposing views on controversial issues of importance to their communities</emphasis>. When it adopted the Fairness Doctrine in 1949, the FCC was just beginning to navigate its way through the murky waters of "fair" and "reasonable" programming. A few years before, it had declared broadcast editorials inconsistent with the public interest. "The broadcaster cannot be an advocate," the FCC said. But then it reversed its decision. In 1987, after almost four decades of trying to decide what is fair and reasonable, the FCC reversed its stand on the Fairness Doctrine, declaring that in all likelihood the doctrine was unconstitutional. Obviously Congress thought otherwise. It passed a bill requiring the FCC to continue to uphold the Fairness Doctrine. President Reagan, however, vetoed the bill, and President Bush has vowed to do likewise if another such bill is passed.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm991469968"><emphasis effect="bold">REVIEW |</emphasis> The first major radio legislation was the Radio Act of 1912, which was followed by a more comprehensive law, the Radio Act of 1927.

Some of the important features of the act included a public interest, convenience, and necessity clause, an independent regulatory commission, a limited license period, and equal treatment of political candidates.

        <para id="import-auto-idm1009954176">As far as we can tell today, the first network was established in 1922 when WGY in Schenectady, New York, and WJZ in Newark, New Jersey, were linked so that both could carry the World Series. Technical quality was poor, but soon AT&amp;T developed ways to improve the fidelity of sound carried over long distances by wire.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm968919200">As with many of the significant developments in broadcasting, sports and politics were important stimulation for the development of networks. AT&amp;T put together the first coast-to-coast network for an election-eve broadcast by President Calvin Coolidge in November 1924. There were 26 stations in the network and an estimated audience of between 20 and 30 million. No president had ever spoken to so many people.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm943930016">In 1925, David Sarnoff proposed that stations belonging to the companies involved in RCA be put into a broadcasting company that could become self-supporting, perhaps even profitable, through the sale of advertising. A year later, the RCA Board of Directors approved the idea of the new company to be owned by RCA, General Electric, and Westinghouse; and in August, the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) came into being. The public announcement stressed that NBC would permanently assure listeners a supply of good programs.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1052357472">A second network, the United Independent Broadcasters, was formed in 1927, when a music promoter and manager, Arthur Judson, found he could not do business with NBC. He lined up 12 stations, arranged financing, and formed his own network. Judson's network became the Columbia Phonograph Broadcasting System in 1927, when it merged with the recording company, and later the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS). CBS was beset with problems from its very start, sorely needing large amounts of money and dynamic leadership. It got both in 1928 from a new major stockholder and president, William S. Paley, who was to lead the company for over half a century.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm944917104">Many other networks were started during the late 1920s and early 1930s, almost all of them restricted to a particular region of the country. Only one other major national radio network developed, although it never achieved the power or prominence of NBC or CBS. The Mutual Broadcasting System was quite a different sort of organization than the other national networks; it was a cooperative. Instead of the network owning stations, the stations owned the network. Most of the programs the Mutual organization carried were produced by one of the affiliated stations rather than by the network. The exceptions were programs produced by sponsors.</para>

With the same assurance that stations would clear the time for sponsored network. programs, it was easier for networks to win advertisers. Option time allowed a network representative to assure a prospective sponsor of a minimum number of stations, including stations in the major cities. Because of its importance, the networks insisted on more and more option time, leaving stations little flexibility to schedule local programs.</para>

        <title>The Development of FM Radio</title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1963530192">An important development in radio broadcasting went almost unnoticed by the American public for almost thirty years. This was FM ("frequency modulation") radio, a radically different means of transmission that produced greater fidelity of sound compared to AM ("amplitude modulation" ) radio and was almost free of static. FM radio was invented by Edwin Armstrong and patented in 1933. Armstrong also built the first experimental FM station a few years later. By the time America entered World War II, about twenty FM stations were on the air.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm340553008">Following World War II, FM was hurt badly by two developments: the rapid growth of television and a shift in the broadcast frequencies allocated by the FCC for FM broadcasting. The developers of both television and FM fought for the radio frequencies then occupied by FM stations. Proponents of television won that fight, and in 1945 the FCC ruled that the FM allocation would be shifted to a radio band with a much higher frequency. (Actually, the change resulted in the entire FM service being placed between television channels 6 and 7.) Even though the shift created space for far more FM stations, it was a severe setback for the medium because it meant that all of the existing FM transmitters and receivers were worthless; stations had to rebuild their operations and their audiences.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm351970128">During the first thirty years of FM development, many of the stations were built by AM station owners in the same community, as insurance against an unknown technological future . However, since relatively few homes were equipped with FM receivers and hence few advertisers were willing to pay for commercials on these outlets, owners saved money on programming by simply carrying the same programs that were on their AM stations. This was known as simulcasting-broadcasting simultaneously on two different frequencies. Thus, the public had little motivation to buy receivers, and advertisers, without an FM audience, had little motivation to buy time, so stations had little money for special programs. It was, as they say, a vicious circle.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm355003056"><figure id="import-auto-idm1179918480"><media id="import-auto-idm1044789408" alt=""><image mime-type="image/png" src="../../media/Picture 1-1900.png" height="369" width="576"/></media></figure>[Chart: Electromagnetic frequency chart showing various applications like AM, VHF and UHF television, CB radio, cellular, etc. Caption: The many services that utilize radio waves are shown in this illustration of the electromagnetic spectrum.]</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm366201520">The situation continued well into the 1960s, when FM radio received a tremendous boost from a combination of factors: (1) the virtual saturation of the AM-frequency band at the same time that the financial health of radio was creating a demand for new stations, (2) the widespread distribution of combination AM-FM radios, and (3) the nonduplication rule enacted by the FCC. Since its first passage in 1966, the FCC has made the nonduplication rule more stringent. Today, an mimer of both an AM and FM station in a town of more than 25,000 people cannot broadcast programs simultaneously on the two stations more than 25 percent of the time. This ensures a greater variety of radio material in your communicationmosaic.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm934080560">With the FCC's nonduplication rule, FM stations began striving for programming formats that would distinguish them from their AM competitors and that would attract listeners and, therefore, advertisers. The greater fidelity of FM made music a natural solution. The popularity of stereo broadcasting, perfected in the early 1960s, also contributed to this solution and aided the growth of FM radio.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm369602112">At the beginning of 1966, when the nonduplication rule went into effect, this country had 4044 AM radio stations and 1525 FM stations. Since then, FM radio has grown far more rapidly than AM radio. By the end of 1984, there were 4823 FM stations on the air compared to 4754 AM stations. Today there are about fifty-six hundred FM stations compared to somewhat less than five thousand AM stations. An even more dramatic change has occurred in the audiences for AM and FM radio. In 1972, FM claimed only 25 percent of the radio audience. In each successive year, its share of the audience has increased-to the point that FM now claims 76 percent of the total radio audience.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1035319024">Accompanying the audience change was a change in the profit picture. By 1980, the pretax profit of the average FM radio station had surpassed that of the average AM and AM-FM combination station. The result has been a sharp shift in the relative desirability of FM and AM station ownership. In the 1950s and early 1960s, few people were willing to put money into an FM station, whereas there was far greater demand for AM stations than there were frequencies available. Today, in most if not all communities, that situation is reversed.</para>

        <para id="import-auto-idm344072016">Another development during World War II, one that went almost unnoticed at the time but that has revolutionized radio and the way many of us receive most of our music, is the tape recorder. Until the war, recording for radio was done with bulky equipment on large, plastic discs. During the war, though, American correspondents used a new, portable device that recorded sound magnetically on a long, thin wire. As our troops overran Germany, they discovered that the Germans had developed an even better medium on which to record-magnetic tape. It had greater fidelity and, unlike wire and disc recordings, could be easily edited. Tape recording was refined rapidly after the war and almost universally adopted for virtually all original recording, radio news gathering, music playback at stations, and home recording and playback.</para>

        <title>International Broadcasting</title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1052203648">Most Americans are hardly aware of another broadcasting service available to them-shortwave. On any given day, and especially in the evening, shortwave signals bring programming from all over the world. Radio Moscow, Radio Beijing, Radio Deutsche Welle, Radio Havana Cuba, and many other operations sponsored by foreign governments, beam English-language programs to potential audiences in the United States. One of the largest international radio services is the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). Unfortunately for these broadcasters and their potential listeners, few Americans own shortwave receivers. Fewer still have receivers with digital scanning to facilitate tuning.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1007343040">Shortwave broadcasting has been around for a long time. As early as 1923, Frank Conrad, the Westinghouse engineer whose amateur broadcast experiments led to the establishment of KDKA, was exploring the use of shortwave signals. What he and others soon discovered was that they could span incredible distances by broadcasting at higher frequencies where the radio waves are shorter-hence the name shortwave. By 1939, NBC, CBS, Westinghouse, and General Electric were all engaged in international shortwave broadcasting.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm962791648">World War II brought commercial international broadcasting to a halt. The government first took over blocks of time from the international stations and eventually the stations themselves. Shortwave broadcasting became an important propaganda tool during the war and was used effectively by Germany and Japan as well as the United States and its allies. In the summer of 1942, the government's first official shortwave service, the Voice of America (VOA), began broadcasting in German from tiny studios in New York City. By mid-1944, VOA was producing 119 hours of programming daily in 50 languages.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm958962928">Had it not been for the cold war in Europe following World War II and the hot war in Korea in the early 1950s, the United States might have abandoned government-sponsored shortwave broadcasting. But the iron curtain descending over Eastern Europe and North Korea's threat to overrun South Korea brought a new purpose to the Voice of America. It would be used to fight communism.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm987920624">During this period, two other American-financed shortwave services were established: Radio Free Europe in 1951 and Radio Liberty in 1953.3 Radio Free Europe was aimed at people in Eastern Europe, while Radio Liberty beamed its signal to the Soviet Union. Unlike Voice of America, which depended on Congress for its funding, these services appeared to be financed by American volunteer organizations sympathetic to the plight of millions of people trapped behind the iron curtain. Actually, most of their financing came from the CIA.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm991406112">It was not until the early 1970s that Congress and the American public learned of the CIA's involvement in Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty. Critics charged that the two shortwave services were relics of the "cold war" and should be abolished. Supporters saw them as important alternatives to Soviet propaganda and as critical champions of human rights.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm353471648">With vivid memories of the Berlin Wall and Soviet troops invading Hungary and Czechoslovakia to stamp out attempted democratic reforms, Congress agreed with the supporters and in 1973 passed the Board for International Broadcasting Act. This Act provided a permanent organization to house the two international broadcast services. Congress could have placed Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty-now called RFE/RL, Inc.-under the United States Information Agency (USIA), an organization created in 1953 to house all of America's media-related public diplomacy operations, including VOA . It chose not to do so, probably because of differences in the two kinds of services. Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty were conceived as surrogate home radio stations, that is, radio stations that sound as if they originate in the countries in which they can be heard. The Voice of America, on the other hand, sounds like what it is, an information or propaganda arm of the United States. Its mission is to present America to the world, to explain U.S. foreign policy, and to be a reliable source of news and information in countries without a free press. These ideas were drafted into law in 1976 with the passage of the VOA Charter.</para>

        <para id="import-auto-idm345402592">In 1985, our government added Radio Marti, an international radio service aimed at Cuba. Radio Marti was named after Jose Marti, the Cuban patriot who led the fight for Cuba's independence from Spain just before the turn of the century. The main support for establishment of the Spanish language service came from Cuban-Americans in Miami and from the Reagan administration. Both were seeking more aggressive ways to combat communism. Congress, wary of a radio war with Fidel Castro, placed Radio Marti under the management umbrella of VOA and the USIA to ensure high standards of operation. However, the mission and programming of Radio Marti are more like those of Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty than those of Voice of America.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm327844880">Programming on the different international radio services varies greatly. The Voice of America, which broadcasts more than a thousand hours each week in 43 languages, is guided by a programming clock or pie chart, representing one hour's worth of programming. That hour is sliced into pieces of news, information, music, Americana, and editorials. In addition to its shortwave broadcasts, VOA broadcasts some programs from stations in foreign countries. It also makes extensive use of satellites to relay programming from its studios in Washington, D.C., to more than a hundred transmitters located in the United States and around the world. The estimated weekly audience for VOA is about 127 million adults.</para><para id="import-auto-idm962367728">Communist and other totalitarian countries have frequently tried to jam VOA by broadcasting on the same frequency as the VOA signal. While the Soviet Union ceased such action, China resumed jamming VOA following the 1989 student demonstrations and subsequent government crackdown. Iraq began jamming VOA broadcasts after it invaded Kuwait in 1990.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm949595104">The programming on Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty is almost all news and information, with many roundtable discussions and correspondent reports on East-West relations, U.S. foreign policy, human rights, and West European politics. Much of the time is devoted to information about the country in which the broadcast is heard, information audiences would not likely have learned from their domestic media until the recent demise of communism. From their headquarters in Munich, West Germany, Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty broadcast over a thousand hours of programming each week in 23 languages to an estimated weekly audience of 55 million listeners. In 1988, the Soviet Union stopped jamming Radio Liberty. Jamming of Radio Free Europe ceased shortly before the overthrow of communist governments in Eastern Europe. </para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1171705920">Radio Marti combines news and public affairs programming with entertainment, particularly radio soap operas called novellas, and music, comedy, and variety shows. There are also religious programs and programs about coping with day-to-day life. Interviews with Cuban emigres suggest that Radio Marti is the most popular station in Cuba. One reason for its popularity is that it can be heard on AM radio as well as shortwave. A series of directional antennae in the Florida ~eys enables Radio Marti to reach Cuba on AM radio, while the shortwave signal is broadcast from a VOA relay station in Greenville, North Carolina. In 1990 Congress authorized funds for a television version of Radio Marti that is broadcast from a blimp high above the Florida Keys. As soon as the service was initiated, however, the Cuban government jammed the television signal and superimposed its own radio station on the Radio Marti AM frequency, thereby jamming both Radio Marti and TV Marti.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1162713936">Congress now appropriates almost $500 million a year for some twenty-three hundred hours of weekly programming on the Voice of America, Radio Free Europe, Radio Liberty, and Radio Marti.4 With the dramatic changes that have taken place in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, there may be no need for these radio services in their present form. However, so long as the United States keeps attempting to win friends and influence events in other countries, radio will continue to be a useful tool in that effort. It is a vital part of our public diplomacy, selling America and American ideals to friendly as well as unfriendly countries.</para>

      <para id="import-auto-idm941652576">World War II was a high point for radio. Never were people more dependent on a mass medium of communication. Radio helped give order to an otherwise chaotic world. Through the efforts of Edward R. Murrow and the many other gifted journalists working in broadcasting, Americans received a meaningful picture of what was happening throughout the world. They were calmed and brought together by the paternal tones of President Franklin Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. And they felt a sense of continuity when they could still listen each week to Jack Benny and Bob Hope and the many other great entertainers who were almost like family members.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm350426784">When the battle with Germany and Japan ended, another sort of battle began for radio: the battle with television. Television of some sort had been around for a long time, but not until World War II did it pose a threat to its parent medium, radio. Prior to that, television had been a toy for inventors and a roulette wheel for speculators, as we will see in the next chapter. By the early 1950s, however, technical developments with the medium and an economic boom that provided funds for investment in stations and receivers started television on its path to dominance. Before long, it was the rare home in which the radio set was not removed from its place of honor in the living room and replaced with a television receiver. Popular radio programs featuring stars such as Jack Benny and Arthur Godfrey had made the transition to the new medium. By 1953, radio was no longer the major nighttime family entertainment medium in this country. Those primetime hours were no longer highly profitable for the sound medium as they had been in the past. In fact, it appeared to many people that no time would be profitable for radio and that the medium was in its death throes.</para>

        <title>The Transformation of Radio </title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm985306608">The obituary, as we know now, was premature. Radio of the 1930s and 1940s died, but radio in new forms came back stronger than ever, at least economically. Radio prospered, in spite of the threat from television, because station operators adjusted their programming and manufacturers adjusted the receiving apparatus to serve different functions than those taken over by television. The pretelevision radio receiver was expensive, large, and heavy; it was a major piece of furniture in the living room. The posttelevision radio receiver, helped by the development of transistors, was inexpensive, small, and portable; it followed us wherever we went.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm366674384">Instead of the traditional radio format of the long drama or situation comedy, which people had to tune in to at a certain time and stay with for at least a half-hour, we now have the sort of programming on most stations that we can turn on or off at any time without feeling we are missing anything special. If we want to listen to some country-and-western music, for example, we do not need to check a schedule to see when such a program is on. Instead, we simply tune to the station that broadcasts such music all day long. If we do not know which station that is, we scan the dial and quickly find it. If we want news, we know that most stations carry some "every hour on the hour," or we can just turn to an all-news station.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1186674096">Much pretelevision radio came from the networks, especially during prime-time hours. It was expensive, with its stars and crews of writers and emphasis on live entertainment. Posttelevision radio discovered that its audience was as willing to listen to recorded music as live music and that the local disc jockey could be as popular with its audience as the network stars of the past had been. Besides, a disc jockey with recorded music provided a flexible format that made it easy to slip in more commercials. If commercial stations rely on a traditional network at all today, it is generally only for news and occasional features.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm376322832">While the old-style radio network is declining, a new type of network is gaining widespread acceptance. Communication satellites are being used increasingly to distribute syndicated shows and, at times, even commercials to local radio stations for transmission. A great deal of news and sports is also "networked" in this way. At last count, ninety percent of the radio stations in the country had earth stations with which they could pick up program material from satellites for broadcast.</para>

        <para id="import-auto-idm992357120">For pretelevision radio, prime time, the time for which the highest advertising rates are asked, was the evening. With television and cable today attracting the bulk of the audience at night, radio's prime time has shifted to early morning and late afternoon. The largest audience for radio is from about 6:00 A.M. to 9:00 A.M. and 3:00 P.M. to 5:00 P.M. These are the hours that have come to be known as drive time, the time when a large percentage of Americans are driving to or from work. Stations program those hours specifically for these drivers. In larger cities, for example, road reports are an important service, broadcast every few minutes during drive time to let commuters know about those streets or bridges that are more congested and those on which they can make better time.</para>

        <para id="import-auto-idm1052224448">Noncommercial radio almost died just before World War II but then surged back stronger than ever in the 1960s and 1970s. Three major factors accounted for this resurgence. One was the development of FM radio, which made many more frequencies available for new stations. In fact, the first 20 of those frequencies were set aside specifically for noncommercial use. Another factor in the resurgence of noncommercial radio was the heightened interest in education, stimulated by America's resolve to catch up with the Soviets in space exploration and by the post-World War II baby boom, which flooded schools and colleges with students in the 1960s. The third factor, caused in large part by the second, was the federal legislation that provided for financial help to educational broadcasting.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm977025040">Today, we have about fourteen hundred noncommercial radio stations operating in this country and a major network, National Public Radio (NPR), to which many of them belong. This network is doing a great deal to make noncommercial radio a national force, even though only about a quarter of the public ever hears any of its broadcasts. NPR's first great coup was probably its live broadcasting of the complete debates in the United States Senate over whether to ratify the treaty that gave the Panama Canal to Panama. This was the first time Congress had ever permitted such broadcasts.</para>

        <title>The Development of Radio Programming</title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1017891264">In the early days of radio, the pioneers of the medium put on the air whatever they could think of that would cost them nothing. However, the development of networks sped the development of quality programming. By the early 1930s, virtually every kind of broadcast programming that we have today on either radio or television had been pioneered. Talks and music dominated the early broadcasting schedules. Vocal, piano, band, and organ recitals filled the air; ballroom dance music became especially popular. And programs were aired on almost any subject someone could be found to talk about. Sports broadcasts came into radio early. Services from a local church were broadcast in Pittsburgh as early as 1921.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1018191216">Although some comedy programs had been on the air earlier, including a program of "negro dialect stories" broadcast on a station in New York in 1923 (obviously well before the strong civil rights movement), comedy became truly popular during the Depression days of 1930, 1931, and 1932. The first stand-up comedian to have his own show was Eddie Cantor. He was one of the many radio stars in the 1930s who helped variety programs dominate the prime-time hours.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm957674304">Other broadcasting forms developed to a high level during this period were situation comedies, such as "Fibber McGee and Molly" and "Amos 'n' Andy"; detective and police stories, such as "The Shadow" and "Gangbusters"; and dramas about lawyers and newspaper people, such as "The Front Page" and "Mr. District Attorney." Drama series, such as the "Lux Radio Theatre," also developed in the 1930s, as did soap operas, so called because most of the sponsors were manufacturers of laundry products. These programs included "Ma Perkins," "Our Gal Sunday," and "The Romance of Helen Trent." Children's serials, many of them based on comic strips, were also part of radio's early expansion. "Little Orphan Annie," "Dick Tracy," "The Lone Ranger," and "Jack Armstrong, the All-American Boy" were favorites.</para>

        <para id="import-auto-idm1122756000">Many newspaper publishers started their own radio stations in these early days, in part because they saw radio as a means of publicizing their papers. Some would read the headlines from the newspaper on the air-teasers-to interest listeners in buying the papers. Some stations not associated with newspapers simply read news stories on the air that they snipped from the local papers. The papers did not object to this practice at first because the stations would usually give them credit: "According to the Quincy Herald Whig . . . " As early as 1921, at least one station, KDKA in Pittsburgh, was doing newscasts from the newsroom of a local paper. Thus, newspapers served this infant medium of radio, even printing program logs as a service to radio fans, and received free publicity in return.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1180779488">By the late 1920s, many radio stations were broadcasting regular newscasts. The major wire services even provided special service to them.

        <title>Publishers’ Attempts to Stifle Radio Competition</title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1051369808">As radio became more commercial, competing with newspapers for advertising, their friendly cooperation was undermined. Newspapers began to perceive radio as a threat, especially when they saw their income declining during the Depression while the income of radio steadily rose. The threat became even greater when radio began "scooping" them regularly, getting stories on the air long before any newspaper could even get an "Extra" edition on the streets. Radio was the first to spread the word that the only child of aviation pioneer Charles Lindbergh had been kidnapped and that someone had tried to assassinate President Franklin Roosevelt.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1027380672">Newspaper publishers fought back. Many stopped printing radio program schedules so that listeners would find it more difficult to find their favorite programs. They put pressure on the wire services not to make news stories available to broadcasters. They were behind the decision by Congress to keep its press galleries closed to broadcast journalists, a ban that was not lifted until 1939.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm995523872">Finally, in 1933, pressure from newspapers and the wire services forced an agreement from the major radio networks to sharply restrict their news broadcasts. In light of the role of broadcasting in news today, it is hard to imagine that this agreement was made. In exchange for free news service from the wire services (Associated Press, United Press, and International News Service), NBC and CBS agreed that they would do no news gathering on their own and that they would broadcast only ten minutes of news a day-five minutes in the morning and five in the evening—timed to come after morning or evening newspapers had been sold. The networks also agreed that no news story would be longer "than 30 words and that special news bulletins would not be issued, except for something of "transcendent importance." Perhaps most surprising of all, they agreed not to permit commercial sponsorship of newscasts. This <emphasis effect="italics">pact between the networks, wire, services, and publishers</emphasis> came to be known as the <emphasis effect="bold">Biltmore Agreement</emphasis> because it took shape during a conference in New York's Biltmore Hotel.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm949720368">Needless to say, this agreement did not work. Local stations moved in to fill the gap it created. Special news services for local radio stations developed, and before long the networks went fully back into the news business. Attempts to artificially inhibit any mass communication medium in this way have never worked; the demands of the audience, the economic incentives, and the competitive drive of the pioneers in each medium are simply too strong.</para>

        <para id="import-auto-idm368989392">In the 1930s, another factor was reshaping the role of radio: World tensions were rising, and the story was too important for radio not to cover. From the day in l936 when H. V. Kaltenborn, squatting in the shelter of a haystack near the Spanish city of Irun, managed to broadcast an eyewitness account of a battle in the Spanish Civil War, it was impossible for anyone to keep a lid on radio news.

Murrow did not begin his career as a journalist; he became one by a quirk of fate. He joined CBS as director of talks in 1935, when he was still in his twenties. Three years later he was in Europe arranging a program for the American School of the Air when word came that Germany was invading Austria.

Since the rise of television and the vast increase in number of competing stations, most radio broadcasters select a segment of the audience they believe they can win and can sell to advertisers, and they broadcast a specialized service for that audience.</para>

        <para id="import-auto-idm346628608">Many kinds of formats exist today, and new formats are constantly evolving. In selecting a format, a station owner or manager studies the market to see what segment of the audience is being inadequately served by other stations and then tries to determine what type of format will attract that audience. For commercial stations, it is critical that the audience attracted be salable to advertisers. That means it must be composed of potential customers for many types of products and must be large enough to warrant broadcast advertising. The larger the city or the <emphasis effect="bold">market area</emphasis>—that is, the area reached by a station's signal—the more specialized the audience to which a format can appeal.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm338819408">For the most part, formats are designed for audiences that fall into certain age, socioeconomic, or ethnic categories. Adult contemporary, rock, and album-oriented rock formats appeal primarily to younger listeners, whereas nostalgia/big band, easy listening, and news formats attract an older audience. Highly educated and more affluent listeners are those more likely to appreciate the classical format, and ethnic groups such as blacks or Hispanics often prefer stations that emphasize their particular culture or language.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm936266736">Country music, as the name suggests, first became popular in rural areas-especially in the South and West-and in urban areas where listeners felt a special kinship with the folk styles of those regions.

At an automated station, the only duties personnel have, other than putting tapes on the machine and starting and stopping them, is either to edit the commercials and station breaks into the tape or to stop the tape periodically for them. Even the latter task is handled by a computer at some stations. A local announcer is necessary only if the station wishes to present local news or other special announcements.</para>

They can also switch to the network for news and back to recorded announcements, music, and commercials. Computer packages print a record or log of what has gone out over the air and the time it went out.</para>

        <para id="import-auto-idm1184039216">In the 1920s, every country in which radio was being developed was exploring ways to fund the operations of this new medium. This had not been a great problem in the early days, because the initial technological developments were funded by large companies that planned to recoup their investments through the lease and sale of equipment. Even the entertainment for broadcasting was readily available without cost because those who sold records were eager for the free advertising, just as musicians and other entertainers were intrigued with the new medium and interested in getting the visibility it offered. Many of the early stations were owned by newspapers and stores, and the owners initially believed that the advertising it gave them justified the costs.</para>

        <title>The Effect of Rising Costs</title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1182715632">As the costs of broadcasting rose, that justification was questioned. The coverage of on-the-spot news events was becoming increasingly popular, and for these the stations needed to lease expensive telephone lines. Musicians, actors, and other artists, who were happy to perform free in the early days of radio because of the novelty, began to demand payment for their work. The composers and publishers of music began to insist on royalties for works of theirs that were broadcast. They wanted an annual fee paid to the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP). Stores and newspapers that owned some of the early stations found that their businesses did not benefit sufficiently to justify these greater costs. Manufacturers of radio receiving equipment also began to doubt that the cost/benefit ratio of supporting stations was in their favor. Audience members had to have radio receivers, of course, but did not necessarily buy them or the parts to construct them from the companies producing and transmitting the programs they wanted to hear.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm376122416">This situation created a dilemma unlike those anyone involved with mass communication or entertainment had encountered before. There simply were no precedents that might suggest ways to fund this new medium. When the motion picture came along, its mode of public presentation was so like vaudeville, the legitimate theater, and the circus that it was obvious to everyone that it should be supported in the same way through the sale of admission tickets. People had to buy books or newspapers, or borrow or rent them from someone who had, before they could read them. In other words, for all previous media, mechanisms were available that permitted control of their consumption and some means of exacting payment from the consumer. Not so with radio. Radio programs were sent out into the atmosphere to be picked up by whoever had the appropriate apparatus. There was no way to control—or even to know—who or where those receivers were.</para>

        <para id="import-auto-idm956593936">As you know, the last mode of supporting radio ultimately came to be the mode that dominated American broadcasting. This is not surprising, when one considers that capitalism has been a dominant force in American life for much of the history of this country, and the early 1920s was an especially vigorous period for the American economy.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm328175072">However, do not assume that our present system of financing most broadcasting was a foregone conclusion or that it was the only viable solution to the problem of supporting radio and, later, television. Great Britain, for example, faced with the same problem at the same time, arrived at quite a different solution. That country placed an annual tax on each radio receiver. To this day an annual tax continues to support the radio and television networks of the BBC.<sup>5</sup> No advertising is permitted on these networks, although regulatory changes proposed by former Prime Minister Thatcher's government may force the BBC to seek alternate sources of funding, including advertising. Other countries chose total government support as the proper means to finance radio broadcasting and with that support, of course, government control. You can find almost every conceivable kind of support used at one time or another in some country.</para>

        <title>The Heterogeneous Support System for Radio in the United States</title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1318426864">The broadcasting system in the United States is primarily commercial; however, stations here are supported in a variety of ways. Although for Radio in no station has been totally endowed by a public-spirited citizen like the United States Andrew Carnegie, the Ford Foundation and some smaller foundations have made substantial contributions to many noncommercial broadcasting stations in this country. Some cities own and totally support radio stations. New York City, for example, began radio station WNYC in 1924 and still operates it. Some states also own and operate radio (and television) stations, either directly or indirectly. For example, the state of Iowa, through its three state universities, owns and operates radio stations in Iowa City, Ames, and Cedar Falls. It also owns and operates the Iowa Public [Television] Broadcasting Network. The state of Wisconsin has owned and operated an educational radio network for many years. At least one radio station in this country is owned by a labor union, and a number of noncommercial stations are supported by contributions from their listeners.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1026097824">In the early days of radio, some members of Congress proposed that the federal government own and operate a powerful radio station that could be received throughout the nation so that the government, and especially the Congress, would have a direct line of communication to citizens. The proposal was promoted by Senator Gerald Nye in 1929. Among other things, the station was to broadcast congressional debates; it was to be a type of audible Congressional Record. This station never became a reality.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1937019168">One idea for supporting broadcasting that received little publicity in those early days but has since become extremely important is support by churches or religious groups. Radio stations, television stations, and production houses owned and operated by religious groups have become a strong force in American broadcasting, and they continue to spread both in this country and abroad. There are probably between seven hundred and eight hundred radio stations and fifty-five to sixty television stations in this country supported substantially or wholly by religious groups. Most religious stations are also supported by the sale of regular advertising. Only about five hundred of the radio stations carry an all religious format.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1014284688">None of this, of course, includes the many syndicated religious television programs. There are between sixty and seventy nationally syndicated devotional programs, many of which are carried by cable systems as well as television stations.</para>

        <title>The Commercial Support of Radio</title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1932575984">AT&amp;T developed the idea of direct, commercial support of radio. It was analogous to the means that had been used to finance telephone and telegraph service, operations with which AT&amp;T had experience. The idea was that anyone could use a station's studio and transmitter for a fee. Whoever wanted to broadcast something to the world—or to the community—would pay according to the length of the broadcast, just as people paid for long-distance telephone calls in terms of their length. AT&amp;T labeled this practice of <emphasis effect="italics">broadcasting for a fee </emphasis><emphasis effect="bold">toll broadcasting</emphasis>.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm366368032">The first organization to take advantage of the toll broadcasting system was the Queensboro Corporation in New York on August 28, 1922. It bought ten minutes of broadcast time for $50 on station WEAF to tell listeners about some apartments it was offering for sale. This ten-minute speech about the virtues of suburban living is considered the first regular commercial in American broadcasting.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm343218976">Indirect advertising had been used on radio before this time, however. Stores that owned broadcasting stations assumed that the constant mention of their names on the air would bring additional customers in. Theaters furnished talent, and record stores and publishers gave records to radio stations, hoping the credits they received on the air would help sales of tickets or records. Another form of indirect advertising was to give a store or product label to a program or group of radio entertainers. Probably the first of these was the "Wanamaker Organ Concerts," named for the John Wanamaker department store in New York City. Before long, radio listeners could hear the "Eveready Hours," the "Lucky Strike Orchestra," the "Ipana Troubadours," the "A&amp;P Gypsies," and the "Texaco Star Theater."</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1162158944">Advertising then, as now, had its opponents. Herbert Hoover denounced it in the early 1920s when he was secretary of commerce. The Newspaper Publishers Association, obviously distressed about radio competing with them for advertising dollars, argued that "advertising by radio is likely to destroy the entertainment and educational value of broadcasting." One congressman even threatened to introduce legislation to ban advertising from the air. This legislation, like other antiadvertising efforts, obviously failed.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm329704896"><emphasis effect="bold">REVIEW |</emphasis> When radio was first developed, no one was quite sure how it should be supported. Although there were calls for government subsidies and private donations, commercial radio eventually adopted the selling of advertisements as a means of support.

        <title>Reasons for the Early Popularity of Radio</title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm326609072">The reasons for radio's immediate success are easy to discern. Like the motion picture, radio did not demand literacy. The immigrant who had just landed at Ellis Island could enjoy the medium almost as much as the well-educated second- or third generation American. Not only could radio be enjoyed; it also provided an education about America. Evidence shows that many immigrants and poorly educated people learned how to handle family problems by listening to soap operas. Men and women alike learned to cope with America and American ways from the varieties of radio dramas. Families were entertained and informed by comedy, variety, and musical shows and by the news broadcasts. Through the worst of the Depression, they were reassured by the fireside chats of President Franklin Roosevelt.</para>

And all of these benefits of radio were essentially free. Once a family acquired a radio receiver and installed it in its special place of honor in the living room, it delivered its treasures without cost. Children could listen to "Jack Armstrong, the All-American Boy" or "The Lone Ranger" during the late afternoons; women could listen to "Ma Perkins," "My Gal Sal," or "Vic and Sade"; and the entire family could gather about the set to laugh and thrill to "The Shadow," "Death Valley Days," "First Nighter," Jack Benny, Fred Allen, and Charlie McCarthy.</para>

        <title>Patterns of Listening Today</title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm375191648">Aided by the new radio formats and the fact that radio receivers are available almost everywhere we go, radio listening today is largely unplanned. We tune in at certain times out of habit, at other times because of a special need, and at still other times on a whim—because we want some background sounds.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm981343712">Our habitual uses of radio center on certain regular activities. For example, some of us always listen to the news while we eat breakfast. Others of us have gotten into the habit of waking up to radio or perhaps are so accustomed to going to sleep with the sounds of radio that we have difficulty nodding off without it.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1184485824">A good example of radio listening for a special need is the listening commuters do during the morning and evening rush hours in urban areas, which we discussed earlier. Drivers need to know what routes are clogged in order to avoid them, where the traffic is lightest, and so on. They also seek some diversion from the boredom of driving. Popular disc jockeys chatting with one another and bantering with their radio audience seem like familiar friends.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm329598880">Almost certainly you have had the experience of simply tuning in radio because you wanted some background sounds or diversion while you are studying or taking a break from studying, while washing dishes, cleaning house, working on your automobile, or perhaps lying on the beach.

        <title>Processing Radio Information</title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm963167664">Radio, probably more than any other medium of communication, has the potential to stimulate our imaginations. Because of the limitations of time and the audio channel, this medium gives us relatively little information. As a result, we listeners are forced to use our imaginations to the fullest to fill the gaps and to construct visual images in our minds from the sounds we hear. Radio writers and directors have made great use of this characteristic, especially in the creation of dramas and documentaries.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm949419168">Unfortunately, most people who work in radio, in the United States at least, no longer think of its imaginative or artistic use—the use of the medium to evoke a world of images, a world that can exist nowhere except in the imagination. A psychologist named Rudolf Arnheim is one of the few scholars who dealt extensively with the aesthetic qualities of this medium.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm945027024">In a book titled <emphasis effect="italics">Radio</emphasis>, published in 1936, he stressed the impact of sound on our processing of information. Although most of us do not realize it, in a drama or documentary the sound of a word, because it is more elemental, is often more important than its meaning. Before we recognize the meaning of a word, we sense its sound. And that sound affects us more directly than the meaning of the word. Skillful radio directors and actors can use this phenomenon in creating their art.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1168781744">A more important factor is involved in our processing of much of the material we hear from radio. From its beginnings, radio has been a source of information and of entertainment, of news and of fantasy. That its reality and its fantasy are confounded is both a strength of radio and one of its problems. This is true in the motion picture also, but in a different way. In a motion picture, there is a confounding of reality and fantasy because we photograph objects that in fact exist but that, through a variety of means, are given symbolic value. The waves seen pounding on a rocky shore in a motion picture are seen as themselves but also as something more: the sign of a storm, a symbol for danger, or the inexorable passage of time.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1036625152">In radio, the confounding of reality and fantasy occurs at another level; it occurs because the medium is both a source of "real" events and a source of fantasy, and we are switched back and forth between.fact and fantasy so quickly and so regularly that fact and fantasy easily become confused.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm995367280">Unfortunately, some advertisers take advantage of that confusion. The most extreme examples occur during radio newscasts when newscasters go from news stories to commercials without warning, without a change of voice, and with copy written in such a way that the commercials sound like news stories. This practice has been frowned upon by the major networks but is common at many local stations and on some syndicated news programs. Because we associate radio with news and live coverage of actual events, we too often process these commercials in the same way we process news. Hence, we fail to be sufficiently critical of the claims being made; we simply accept them. Paul Harvey's news programs, heard throughout the United States, are among the slickest examples of this practice.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1044483360"><emphasis effect="bold">REVIEW |</emphasis> Today, radio listening is usually the backdrop for some other activity such as eating or washing dishes or driving. Despite its ability to stimulate our imaginations, radio is rarely used as skillfully as it once was. The fact that it blends fantasy and reality is both a strength and a source of problems, especially when news programming and commercials are intertwined.</para>

      <title>THE FUTURE OF RADIO</title>
      <para id="import-auto-idm342420864">The future of radio is difficult to predict; there are too many unknown factors. One unknown is whether Congress will agree to further deregulation of the medium. Although the Federal Communications Commission regulates radio far less than it did a decade or two ago, nearly absolute freedom from regulation might alter the industry quite substantially.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm1007671520">Another unknown factor is the increased use of international communications satellites and cable. Although cable systems and the satellites are thought of largely in terms of television, they are also making available in our homes a greater range of radio materials. As the choices increase and each station must struggle harder for even a small portion of the potential audience, the intense competition may have a substantial impact on the industry. If that impact leads to more imaginative programming and other efforts to woo the segment of the audience with minority tastes that today's offerings fail to satisfy, the result could be positive. On the other hand, if that impact is to reduce the audience for any one station so much that radio becomes unprofitable, there may be no incentive to invest either funds or imagination in the medium, and the result could be negative.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm1177854016">The most serious threat to radio at the moment is to the AM service, which has been experiencing a steady decline in audience, down from 75 percent of the overall radio audience in 1972 to just 26 percent now. In 1988, about half of the AM stations lost money. The biggest handicap has been the inability to compete with FM, which has a more consistent signal, higher fidelity, and stereophonic sound. Many organizations, such as the FCC and Congress, are studying the AM problem and soliciting suggestions on how to improve the service. Some of these suggestions include working with receiver manufacturers to develop high-quality AM radios that feature stereo, higher fidelity, and continuous AM-FM tuning, and requiring by law that all new radios receive the ten new frequencies (from 1605 to 1705 on the AM dial) that just became available, and that all new FM stereos also receive AM stereo.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm1814911232">One thing seems certain about radio's future (and about the future of all communications media): the trend toward consolidation will continue at least for the foreseeable future. A large portion of the radio stations in this country are already parts of groups, a set of broadcasting outlets under single, corporate ownership. For years, many of these groups have included television stations and newspapers. Recently, however, the corporate entities are mushrooming. Although there is a ceiling on the number of radio and television stations that one corporation can own (12 AM stations, 12 FM stations, and 12 television stations), there is no ceiling on the size of the rest of the corporation. Increasingly, radio stations find themselves in corporations that own not only television stations and a growing number of newspapers, but book publishers, billboard companies, and noncommunications industries as well. This development means that ownership is being moved further and further away from the operations end of the broadcasting stations. Many observers fear that with increasing distance will come decreasing concern for the public interest, convenience, or necessity.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm981399488"><emphasis effect="bold">REVIEW |</emphasis> The future of radio depends in part upon whether there will be more or less government deregulation and whether other media such as cable television will have a positive or negative impact on listening. At the moment, the most serious threat is to AM radio, which has experienced a steady erosion of its audience. Like other communications media, radio stations will increasingly become parts of larger corporate entities.</para>

      <title>THE CHANGEABLE MEDIUM WE CALL RADIO: A SUMMARY</title>
      <para id="import-auto-idm381689152">Every medium of mass communication goes through a series of stages in its development to maturity. In none do we see those stages as clearly as we do in the history of radio. First is the stage of technology or invention, in which the medium is dominated by engineers and tinkerers. In the case of radio, these pioneers were concerned with either developing or improving some technical aspects of the medium, such as getting the signal to carry further or to have greater fidelity, or else they were interested in radio as a hobby or toy, something to play with after work or on weekends.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm938830016">In the second stage, which generally overlaps the first, the medium is perceived, planned for, and used as something other than what it ultimately becomes. In the case of radio, it was initially perceived and used simply as a medium for point-to-point communication-communication from shore stations to ships or from one amateur wireless operator to another.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm946339264">The third stage is that in which the mature function or functions of the medium are generally recognized and developed. For radio, this stage occurred when the medium began to flourish as an entertainment, information, advertising, and propaganda medium. As with other media, the development of radio's main functions was accompanied by a change in the type of person dominating it; the engineers and tinkerers became less important, replaced by a special breed of entrepreneurs. Not only were they promoters; they were also people fascinated with the medium—in the case of radio, fascinated with the news and entertainment potential of the medium—and they made great contributions to the development of these aspects.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm349453472">In the fourth stage, as a medium fully matures and becomes a major and complex industry, still another type of person comes to dominate, one concerned primarily with business and management. However, in radio, as with the other major mass media, individuals whose primary concerns were entertainment and information continued to play important roles.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm975496032">For most of the mass media there has been at least one additional stage. As new media come along and take over some of a medium's traditional functions, it must change, often quite substantially. This happened to radio when television came along. Television took over much of the entertainment and information functions of radio, along with its audience, especially its prime-time audience, and radio had to find new functions and new audiences. In its present stage, although it has not totally abandoned entertainment and information, radio has become primarily a background medium, something unobtrusive and undemanding to listen to while we do other things. In a sense, it is quite a different medium than it was before the advent of television. Whether there will be additional stages in the development of radio, only time will tell.</para>

        <item>Much of the material on the history of radio is based on the excellent three volume History of Broadcasting in the United States by Erik Barnouw (New York: Oxford University Press 1966-1970). For students of radio, these volumes are fascinating.</item>
        <item>More details on the early history of educational radio can be found in Werner J. Severin, "Commercial vs. Non-Commercial Radio During Broadcasting's Early Years," Journal of Broadcasting 22 (1978): 491-504.</item>
        <item>From 1952 to 1954, the United States financed the operation of another service, Radio Free Asia. According to Barnouw, few Asians had shortwave receivers, and the service failed to generate the kind of support among intellectuals that Radio Free Europe had. Since 1985, there has been a Radio Free Afghanistan, which was created in response to the Soviet invasion of that country. Administratively, it is part of Radio Liberty.</item>
        <item>This figure does not include the American Forces Radio and Television Service (AFRTS), which provides programming for U.S. military personnel overseas, nor does it include clandestine broadcasting stations supported by the CIA.</item>
        <item>The British developed a way to insulate radio from too much government interference by making the British Broadcasting Corporation an autonomous body. The British Parliament does not directly control the tax funds that go to broadcasting. The license fees are paid to the Postal Service, which simply turns them over to the BBC. We should also note that there is a commercial television system in Great Britain today that competes with the BBC for listeners, though not for financial support.</item>
