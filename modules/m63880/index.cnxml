In his first account of his discovery, written in 1839, Talbot included a subheading titled "On the Art of Fixing a Shadow," where he described what he believed to be the domain of photography. "The most transitory of things," he wrote, "a shadow, the proverbial emblem of all that is fleeting and momentary, may be fettered by the spells of our 'natural magic,' and may be fixed for ever in the position which it seemed only destined for a single instant to occupy."

Unlike the camcorder, which was introduced just a little over a decade ago, or the super 8 motion picture camera that preceded it, amateur still photography has been around since the turn of the century. Most of our homes are filled with treasured pictures of families, friends, places, and occasions—bits of information embedded in our memories, reminders of who we were, where we came from, and, perhaps, why we are the way we are today. Photography is also an important medium of mass communication, one that is both an integral part of other mass media, such as newspapers and magazines, and a medium unto itself. Published in book form or exhibited in art museums, photographs as works of art range from the avant-garde images of Man Ray and Chuck Close to the stark realism of Dorothea Lange and Walker Evans. Like the motion picture and radio and television, <emphasis effect="bold">photography</emphasis>, which literally means <emphasis effect="italics">"writing or drawing with light"</emphasis> had its origins in scientific invention.</para>

      <title>TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS </title>
      <para id="import-auto-id1164569200265">No one knows for sure when or where the idea originated of obtaining a permanent and objective reproduction of the visible world, but human beings appear to have always had an urge to communicate their views of the environment. Before the development of writing, they did almost all of this communication with pictures. As far back as ten to twenty thousand years ago they were communicating their visual experiences by drawing on the walls of caves in southern France and northern Spain, and some of these early images were remarkably realistic. Continuously since that time, through paintings and sculptures, artists have continued to document their world.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1164569200267">In some instances, as in portrait painting, these early artists achieved great fidelity. But it was not until much later that a different form of painting—painting with light—enabled them to reproduce effortlessly what their eyes perceived. In the early part of the nineteenth century the paths of two scientific discoveries merged to produce a workable system of photography. The first path, which involved an optical system capable of capturing an image, had its roots in pinhole imagery and the discovery of how to make and grind glass into lenses that could project an image. The other path had to do with the chemical reaction that occurs when silver salts are exposed to light.</para>
      <section id="import-auto-id1164569245481">
        <title>The Camera</title>
        <para id="import-auto-id1164569245484">The optical principle upon which the camera was developed was known to the ancient Greeks, who observed that sunlight passing through a pin-sized hole in the wall of a darkened room produced the sun's image on the opposite wall. Early astronomers seeking ways to study solar eclipses without damaging their eyes were the first to find a practical application for this phenomenon. It was not until the late Renaissance that the idea of designing a camera for pictorial purposes and incorporating the "pinhole image formation" principle emerged. Inspired by major strides in artistic development that began in the late thirteenth century, Giovanni Battista Della Porta suggested the use of a camera as a sketching device.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1164569200217">The earliest <emphasis effect="bold">camera obscura</emphasis>, or <emphasis effect="bold">dark chamber</emphasis>, was <emphasis effect="italics">a darkened room in which a tiny ray of sunlight through a small hole in the wall projected an inverted and laterally reversed image on a white wall opposite the hole</emphasis> (Figure 6.1). Later, a glass lens was placed over the hole, thereby increasing the brightness of the projected image. By the late seventeenth century, refinements in lens-making and smaller, more portable cameras made possible a practical means of projecting an image onto a flat surface, placing tracing paper over it, and sketching a reasonably faithful reproduction. A half-century later, cameras were being fashioned to fit specific needs. Depending upon the size of the camera and the focal length of the lens, some were better suited for sketching portraits, while others provided a better perspective for illustrating landscapes and panoramas. The invention of photography—and the development of the camera as we know it—might be thought of as the substitution of a chemical means of recording the camera's images for the laborious task of drawing them by hand.</para>

        <title>The Photograph </title>
        <para id="import-auto-id1164563059089">While the chemical action of light—such as sunlight darkening the skin or bleaching a fabric—is a common phenomenon, its application to the photochemical process was not understood until the development of chemistry in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. In 1725, a German chemistry professor, Johann Heinrich Schulze, found that silver salts darkened when exposed to light. Later, a Swedish chemist, Carl Wilhelm Scheele, observed that silver chloride was soluble in ammonia but became insoluble when exposed to light. These discoveries and others that followed provided a basis for chemically producing the imprint of an object on a specially coated surface and then preserving that imprint.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1164562891777">At first, experiments were conducted by pressing objects, such as leaves or insect wings, in contact with a photosensitive material and exposing them to sunlight. The more translucent parts of the objects darkened while the opaque features blocked the light. The result was called a "profile" or "photogram." Unfortunately, at that time there was no way to stop the chemical process, so once the photogram was exposed to further sunlight, it darkened uniformly.</para>

</para><para id="import-auto-id7856319">Another forerunner of photography took shape when a French physicist, Joseph Nicephore Niepce, attempted to fix photochemically the image produced by a camera. Having first experimented with <emphasis effect="bold">lithography</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">a printing process that allows chemically treated ink drawings to be transferred from a porous stone or plate to paper</emphasis>, Niepce turned to the camera obscura as a means of producing an image. (One reason Niepce sought the aid of a camera was that his son, on whom he had depended for drawing images, left for the army.) By 1824, he had succeeded in coating a pewter plate with a light-sensitive asphalt varnish and exposing it in a camera to the action of light. The procedure took some eight hours, but gradually the asphalt on the light-exposed parts hardened, while the unexposed parts remained soluble in a mixture of oil of lavender and turpentine and could be removed through a process we now call development. The result was a crude positive image that Niepce called a <emphasis effect="bold">heliograph</emphasis>, from the Greek words meaning sun (<emphasis effect="italics">helios</emphasis>) and to write (<emphasis effect="italics">graphein</emphasis>). <emphasis effect="italics">The first complete photographic system</emphasis> was named <emphasis effect="bold">heliography</emphasis>. Despite its possibilities, heliography was handicapped by the long exposure time required and the delicacy of the operation.</para>

        <para id="import-auto-id1164561102963">In 1829, Niepce formed a partnership with L. J. M. Daguerre, a successful painter, entrepreneur, and fellow experimenter. Niepce died in 1833, but Daguerre continued the work in heliography and by 1837 had created <emphasis effect="italics">a practical photographic process</emphasis>, which he called <emphasis effect="bold">daguerreotypy</emphasis>, completely <emphasis effect="italics">different from the process invented by Niepce</emphasis>. Daguerre used silvered metal plates that had been fumed with iodine vapor to produce silver iodide (the light-sensitive coating). The plates were placed in the camera for about twenty minutes and afterwards fumed with vapors of heated mercury to develop them. The results were astonishing—exquisitely detailed pictures with a richness and finish that heretofore had been impossible to produce.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id8659340">Daguerre discovered that he could stabilize the pictures-that is, prevent them from continuing to develop—by bathing them in a strong solution of ordinary table salt. The process was sold to the French government in 1839, the date generally accepted as the beginning of photography. Because of its low cost and relative ease of operation, daguerreotype portraiture became enormously popular in the 1840s and paved the way for the development of commercial photography and a photographic supply industry. Still, daguerreotype photography had one important drawback: there was no way to make multiple copies of a picture. It was a one-of-a-kind process.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1164561555857">The solution to the problem lay in a process that was developed by an English scientist, William Henry Fox Talbot. Working at the same time as Daguerre, Talbot devised a photographic system that produced tonally reversed, or "negative," prints. To re-reverse the tonality, Talbot simply printed the negative onto a new piece of sensitized paper, thereby producing a positive print. The advantage of this new procedure was that more than one print could be made from a negative. The disadvantages were that the finished product had less resolution than the daguerreotype, and exposure time was quite long—as much as two to three hours in bright sunlight. In 1840, Talbot invented an entirely new means of developing negatives. Experiments with a solution of silver nitrate, acetic acid, and gallic acid yielded a much more sensitive negative that reduced exposure time to a minute or two or even, in strong sunlight, to a few seconds. The new <emphasis effect="bold">calotype</emphasis> process, <emphasis effect="italics">the first negative-positive system of making photographs</emphasis>, provided the technical basis for modern photography.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id2283441">The lack of resolution in finished prints led other scientists to experiment with alternate ways to make negatives. Of particular importance was the work of Talbot's friend, Sir John Herschel, who coined the term <emphasis effect="italics">photography</emphasis>. Herschel had earlier suggested the use of sodium thiosulfate (hypo) as a fixing agent, a practice still in existence today. Later, Herschel experimented with the use of glass plates as an emulsion base.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1865828"><emphasis effect="bold">REVIEW | </emphasis>The earliest photographic process was called heliography. In 1839, the date generally recognized as the beginning of photography, L. J. M. Daguerre sold his daguerreotypy process to the French government. The next year the calotype process was introduced, followed by the collodium wet-plate process in 1851 and a dry-plate process twenty years later.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id2843449">But the real breakthrough in the development of a glass-plate process was made in 1851 by the amateur English photographer, Frederick Scott' Archer. Archer's <emphasis effect="bold">collodium wet-plate process</emphasis> was <emphasis effect="italics">a negative-positive system similar to that of Talbot, except that it yielded a much more highly detailed print and was less cumbersome to work with</emphasis>. Collodium, a highly volatile mixture of ether, alcohol, and nitrated cellulose, bound photosensitive silver salts to a sheet of glass. While still wet, the glass was loaded into the camera, exposed, and then processed before the emulsion dried out. One advantage of the collodium process was that it was far more predictable than the paper negative process and usually more sensitive to light; furthermore, it did away with the poisonous mercury vapors used in the daguerreotype process, and the size of the negatives was limited only by the size of the equipment. By 1856, nearly all photographers had converted to the wetplate process, although some began substituting <emphasis effect="italics">thin metal plates</emphasis> for glass <emphasis effect="italics">to hold the collodium emulsion</emphasis>. These metal plates became known as tintypes. The fact that collodium negatives could be printed quickly and easily by relatively unskilled workers gave rise to the mass production of cheap photographic prints and to a large-scale commercial photography industry and photographic publishing companies.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id2232906">The next major advancement in photographic technology was a <emphasis effect="bold">dry-plate process</emphasis> introduced in 1871 by an English physician, Richard L. Maddox. <emphasis effect="italics">The dry plate substituted a gelatin for collodium</emphasis>. Until this time, photographers had to carry their equipment with them in order to process the collodium emulsions before they dried. Photographers who ventured outside had to take a wagonload of equipment-camera, glass plates, chemicals, trays, and measuring utensils—and a tent that served as a darkroom. With the dry-plate process, the photographs could be developed later. By the late 1870s, improvements in the gelatin emulsion reduced exposure time to 1/25 of a second and freed photographers from having to use tripods to take pictures. Subjects who only a few years before had to sit for several minutes while the chemical action of light worked its magic in the camera now merely had to look at the camera momentarily for the photographers to complete their work. This development changed not only the process of photography but also its subject matter.</para>

      <title>THE PRACTICE OF PHOTOGRAPHY </title>
      <para id="import-auto-id8465884">Early photographers were fascinated by their ability to record the vis- ible world accurately. For this reason, perhaps, the initial function of photography-one that persists to this day-was to capture the look of things.

        <title>Portrait Photography </title>
      <para id="import-auto-id1164563161572">Almost as soon as the daguerreotype process was introduced to the world, portrait studios sprang up in cities across Europe and America, as photographers and would-be photographers pursued commercial exploitation of the new invention. Many of the daguerreotype portraits were modeled after the hand-painted miniatures that preceded them and showed much attention to the pose, placement, and lighting of subjects.</para><para id="import-auto-id2593155">In the United States, the first commercial studio was opened in 1840 by John Johnson and Alexander Wolcott, who constructed their own studio camera and made considerable improvements in daguerreotype photography. An item in the <emphasis effect="italics">New York Sun</emphasis> of Wednesday, March 4, of that year heralded the new enterprise:</para>

We have seen one, taken on Monday, when the state of the atmosphere was far from favorable, the fidelity of which is truly astonishing. The miniatures are taken on silver plate, and enclosed in bronze in cases, for the low price of three dollars for single ones. They really deserve the attention of the scientific, and are valuable acquisition to art, and to society in every respect.</quote></para><para id="import-auto-id1164561061604"><emphasis effect="bold">BYLINE | </emphasis>Early portrait photographs were often framed in a mat, protected by glass, and placed inside an attractively designed miniature case.

      <para id="import-auto-id7401490">Daguerreotypes soon became familiar household items and an integral part of American culture. Within a decade there were almost a thousand daguerreotype photographers in America and probably five times that many people involved in servicing the new profession. Two of the more famous photographers of that era were Mathew Brady and Jesse H. Whitehurst. Brady, who had studios in New York and Washington, photographed such political luminaries as Andrew Jackson, John Quincy Adams, John C. Calhoun, Henry Clay, Abraham Lincoln, and Jefferson Davis. Whitehurst, a flamboyant organizer-promoter, at one point operated as many as seven studios. Among his many distinguished clients—whose photographs were sold to the public—were General Franklin Pierce, General Winfield Scott, Daniel Webster, Stephen A. Douglas, and numerous theater personalities.</para>

        <para id="import-auto-id1164561065246">Advancements in the process of photography, along with the industrialization of society and the lure of the faraway, offered new possibilities for photographers who wanted to venture outside the studio. Roger Fenton, an English photographer who traveled to Russia in the early 1850s,took pictures of the Crimean War for a London newspaper, which made wood engravings of the photographs in order to print them in the paper.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1164561439764">In America, the gold rush of 1849 and the settling of the West attracted a horde of photographers who doggedly trekked across mountains and plains to document the look of hastily constructed cities, gold diggings, and the exquisite natural beauty they encountered along the way. Among them was an artist-turned-photographer, William Henry Jackson, a Civil War veteran who grew restless in his comfortable New England surroundings and headed west in 1866. Working first as a sign painter and art instructor in Chicago, Jackson saved enough money to travel to St. Louis, where rail lines ended and westbound trails began. He worked on a wagon train hauling food and supplies to Montana goldfields before landing his first job as a photographer's helper. In 1870, he was hired as a photographer for a government geological expedition and within a matter of years was well on his way to becoming the most celebrated landscape photographer in America. Jackson's photographs, mostly albumin prints made from collodium wet plates, included stunning panoramas of some of the West's most beautiful scenery—the Teton and Wind River Ranges, the San Juans, Colorado's central Rockies, and Yellowstone. The photographs of Yellowstone so impressed Congress that in 1872 it created the world's first national wilderness park.</para>

        <title>Documentary Photography</title>
        <para id="import-auto-id1164561050311">Rather than emphasizing portraits or landscapes, some early photographers turned their attention to the relationship between people and their environment. Working in the field instead of the studio, these photographers pioneered what is now called documentary photography. One event that helped shape this development was the exploration of the West. In addition to capturing the magnificent natural beauty of the territory west of the Mississippi, photographers documented all aspects of frontier living-wagon trains making their way westward, Indians still largely untouched by the outside world, even themselves loading and unloading their cumbersome gear or standing beside their processing tents.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id7498700">But more than anything, it was the Civil War that gave photographers the opportunity to show the evocative power of the documentary. Whether it was soldiers enduring the rigors of camp life or bloated bodies strewn across a battlefield, photographers were there to record the moment so the rest of the world could see and experience the many faces and horrors of war. Oliver Wendell Holmes, the American writer whose son—later to become a Supreme Court justice—was wounded several times during the war, said of the battlefield photographs of Antietam:</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id8473368"><quote id="eip-id1170564135678">
It was so nearly like visiting the battlefield to look over these views, that all of the emotions excited by the actual sight of the stained and sordid scene, strewed with rags and wrecks, came back to us, and we buried them in the recesses of our cabinet as we would have buried the mutilated remains of the dead they too vividly represented.<sup>2</sup>
</quote></para><para id="import-auto-id1164562124729">Mathew Brady, already a famous portrait photographer, was among the first to conceive of the war-and the prominent figures engaged in the war effort-as subject matter for the camera. Using the improved wet-plate process, he first concentrated on Union troops camped around Washington but soon ventured onto the battlefield, where he and his staff recorded some of the most memorable and shocking scenes of the war. Some of the photographs attributed to Brady were actually made by his talented assistants—Alexander Gardner, George N. Bernard, and Timothy H. O'Sullivan, who would later make his mark as a landscape photographer. Gardner published two volumes of Civil War photographs, which included haunting pictures of the dead at Gettysburg.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1164561519226">Two other photographers who recorded memorable battlefield scenes were John Reekie and Andrew Joseph Russell. Reekie's photographs in particular stirred Northern passions. One showed a burial detail of recently freed slaves going about the grisly business of removing the skeletons of Union soldiers who had been left on the field of battle the year before by victorious Confederate troops. Unlike most of the wartime photographers, Russell was a soldier assigned by the War Department to take pictures for the Corps of Engineers. Many of his photographs were of bridges and pontoons and other types of construction, but he also received permission to record the aftermath of battle. His photograph of dead Confederate soldiers scattered along a low rock wall at Fredericksburg was a grim reminder of what war was all about.</para>

      <title>AMATEUR PHOTOGRAPHY </title>
      <para id="import-auto-id7702389">In the latter part of the nineteenth century, improvements in photographic film and camera design and the rapid growth of' the photographic industry resulted in a technology easily available to ordinary people who wanted to record everyday life experiences. Richard L. Maddox's gelatin dry-plate process laid the foundation for popularizing photography on a grand scale. But it was George Eastman who created a mass market for amateur photography when he introduced an inexpensive, easy-to-use, lightweight camera with a roll-film system and a photofinishing industry to take care of the complicated and laborious task of transforming exposed negatives into positive prints.</para><section id="import-auto-id1164561660013">
        <title>Eastman Kodak</title>
        <para id="import-auto-id1164561687569">A little more than a decade after the Civil War, George Eastman, a bank clerk in Rochester, New York, took up a new hobby—photography. At the time, amateurs were generally discouraged by the complexity of picture taking. The collodium wet-plate process was still the predominant means of taking pictures, and while it was an improvement over earlier photographic systems, it was incredibly cumbersome by today's standards. But Eastman, being mechanically inclined, quickly mastered the intricacies of the technology and began experimenting with the recently developed dry-plate process, which he had read about in the <emphasis effect="italics">British Journal of Photography</emphasis>. In 1879, he invented and patented a machine for making the dry plates used in cameras. Two years later, Eastman and a partner, Henry A. Strong, formed the Eastman Dry Plate Company, which was reorganized in 1892 as the Eastman Kodak Company.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1164561046858">The first revolutionary change Eastman brought to photography was the flexible roll of film to replace the bulky glass plate. The roll was made of paper coated with a dry emulsion. Two rollers inside the camera allowed the operator to spool the film continuously through the camera. Shortly after introducing the roll-film system, Eastman switched from paper to celluloid backing, thereby creating a completely transparent, flexible film. (Thomas Edison's assistant, William Dickson, later added sprocket holes to the film and incorporated this advance into the development of the motion picture camera and a device for viewing film. See the next chapter.)</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1164563202346">Another revolutionary development in photography occurred in 1888 when Eastman introduced the Kodak box camera. It consisted of nothing more than a lens, film holder, and shutter mechanism. The light, portable camera measured 3¼ by 3¾ by 6½ inches and held a 100-exposure roll of film. The camera—film and all—sold for $25. Over the next several years, the combination of mass demand and modification resulted in a camera that was even cheaper and easier to use—the Brownie, which Eastman introduced in 1900 at the astonishingly low price of $1. According to one report, more than one hundred thousand Brownie cameras were sold that first year.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id2980228">But the Eastman innovation that really created a mass market for photography was a system for processing film. The greatest obstacle to amateur photography had been the complicated tasks of film developing and printing. But with the Kodak, the photographer simply took the pictures and then sent the camera and its contents to the Eastman Kodak factory. There the camera would be unloaded and the film processed. The developed prints would be returned to the customer along with the camera and a new roll of film. As a Kodak camera advertisement in 1890 said: "You press the button, we do the rest." Public acceptance was instantaneous. By 1895, there were an estimated 1.5 million roll-film cameras in use throughout the world. Photography had become an international hobby.</para><para id="eip-463"><media id="kodak_ad_1909" alt="An advertisement for Kodak cameras (1909).

It could act as a casual observer, capturing the very instant of a smile or frown, gesture or movement.</para>

Even sketch artists began copying their drawings from photographs. By the time the Civil War ended, illustrations of photographs had appeared in most major publications. Still, there was no way to short circuit the process—that is, to print photographs directly onto the paper in the same manner as text—because presses at that time could print only black and white, or "full" tones.

Ives, working in the photographic laboratories of Cornell University, who first understood the need to break up the light and dark tones of a photograph into a series of dots and to transfer them onto a printing plate.

Thus, by creating an optical illusion, Ives was able to overcome the limitation of the printing process.

Jacob Riis, a <emphasis effect="italics">New York Sun</emphasis> police reporter, knew well the wretched and dangerous slums of his beat in New York City. He had lived there for seven years after emigrating from Denmark in 1870—sometimes sleeping in doorways and picking his meals from trash bins. Deeply touched by all he had seen and experienced, Riis set out to inform the rest of society of the sordid environment in which the urban poor lived. At first, he wrote newspaper articles and gave lectures to middle-class audiences in the New York area, often supplementing his talks with maps and graphs. But, in 1877, he read about the discovery of magnesium flash powder and realized that, with the camera's new capability of shooting in darkened alleys and sunless rooming houses, he had an opportunity to offer visual proof of the horrors of poverty. The Sun published drawings of his photographs in 1888 along with an article titled "Flashes from the Slums."

As early as 1898, George Grantham Bain, a newspaper writer and photographer, began accumulating pictures that he then sold to subscribers. By 1905 he had acquired, catalogued, and cross-indexed a million news photographs. Business was brisk and competition keen as rival picture services battled Bain to provide editors with photographs of "spot" news events. In 1919, the Hearst organization formed International News Photos (INP). Shortly thereafter, two other services appeared—Wide World Photos and Acme Pictures. Associated Press (AP) began its photo service in 1927. Eventually, INP and Acme would become part of United Press International (UPI), while Wide World Photos would be acquired by AP. Although the transmission of photographs by wire began in the 1890s, it was not until 1935 that one of the major news agencies, Associated Press, established a wirephoto service to furnish member newspapers with photographs of current events. With equipment from Bell Laboratories and American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&amp;T) lines, AP set up a 25-station network and ushered in the era of rapid picture transmission. Other news services soon followed suit. Along with AP, they became a main source of photographs for newspapers that did not have their own engraving operations.</para><para id="import-auto-id1164561848246">The worst excesses of the tabloid newspapers subsided in the 1930s, as journalism and photojournalism reached out in new directions. Technological advancements resulted in new cameras coming on the market that were smaller, lighter, and more flexible. Among the most popular of these cameras was the German-made Leica, which had extremely fast, removable lenses and used a roll of 35-millimeter motion picture film. Because of its ability to take as many as forty pictures without reloading and under almost any conditions, it was often preferred over the Graflex and the Speed Graphic as the best camera for taking action photos unobtrusively. Another popular camera was the Ermanox, also a product of Germany and small in size, with an extra-fast lens. Its major drawback was that, unlike the Leica, which used spool-wound 35-millimeter film, the Ermanox took individually loaded glass plates. The first news photographer to make extensive use of these miniature cameras was Eric Salomon of Germany. Often referred to as the "father of candid photography" and perhaps the first to use the term photojournalism to describe his work, Salomon specialized in taking candid shots of public figures going about their work.

Under the direction of Roy Stryker, an economist familiar with the work of Riis and Hine, the FSA hired some of the most talented photographers in America. To gain public support for New Deal works, Stryker made FSA photos available to any interested publication, and many of them found their way into newspapers, magazines, and even books.

Thus, the press was not informed of the 1983 invasion of Grenada until after it occurred. In the invasion of Panama in 1989, a tightly controlled press pool accompanied U.S. troops. How much freedom do you believe journalists and photogournalists should have? Should they be informed in advance of a pending military strike? Should they be allowed to follow troops into battle?

She later accompanied U.S. forces when they liberated the concentration camp at Buchenwald. Her haunting photos of prisoners suddenly set free informed the world of the horrors of the German death camps. Even more grim were the pictures of the dead. George Rodger photographed the mangled pile of bodies found at Bergen-Belsen, while Robert Capa documented what was left of the Warsaw ghetto.

        <title>New Challenges and Directions </title>
        <para id="import-auto-id3352218">By the end of World War II, photojournalists were recognized as artists on a par with writers. Initially, photographers had been regarded as second-class citizens in the newspaper industry—people who chased firetrucks and took snapshots of beauty contests and handshaking ceremonies. But the impressive contributions of photographers throughout the 1930s and during World War II changed that image. Some photographers, aware of their new status and interested in preserving it, formed trade associations and cooperatives. In 1945, a photographer with the <emphasis effect="italics">Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph</emphasis> began organizing the National Press Photographers Association, the major trade association for photojournalists. Two years later, a cooperative agency, Magnum Photos, was founded by Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Capa, Maria Eisner, David (Chim) Seymour, George Rodger, and William and Rita Vandivert to ensure that photographers, rather than the publications in which their photographs appeared, would own the rights to their works. Today, Magnum is considered the most renowned collective of documentary photographers in the world.</para><para id="import-auto-id8490707">For a time, the photojournalist as visual historian reigned supreme. Many of the World War II photographers witnessed the descending of an Iron Curtain in Europe, Gandhi's passive resistance movement in India, the Communist takeover of China, and the Korean War. Their photographs were grabbed up by newspapers and picture magazines eager to show curious readers the world beyond their reach. But about that time, another medium made its appearance and gradually eclipsed the picture magazine as chief chronicler of world events. Television, which entered American homes on a large scale just after World War II, forced all other media to reevaluate their functions and forms. None could compete with television's immediacy and convenience. The Vietnam conflict, in which the United States fought in the 1960s and 1970s, was the first television war—a war brought into the living rooms of Americans on a daily basis.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1164563354046">When television switched to color in the 1960s, photojournalists began using more high-speed color film.

At a memorial service held at Syracuse University for students killed in the crash of a Pan American jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, photographers packed the aisles and balconies of the chapel to take pictures of grieving families and students. Noisy motor drives and frequent flashes of light punctuated the prayer vigil. Should cameras have been allowed in the chapel? If so, what kinds of restrictions should have been placed on their use? What rules of conduct should the photojournalists have observed as a matter of professional ethics?</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id8982862">Despite competition from television, the power of the photograph appears greater than ever. Whether it be of a single man blocking a line of tanks in Beijing or of masses of people dying from famine in Africa, the photograph speaks to us in a way that sometimes words and motion pictures cannot. In an age of information overload and kaleidoscopic visual sensations, still photographs allow us to pause and reflect on the significant—and sometimes insignificant—people, issues, and events of the day. Like paintings, they invite us to consider the personal vision of the photographer against the backdrop of our own experiences. When accompanied by words, as in newspaper or magazine articles, photographs often provide us with the context for constructing the meaning of those articles.

      <title>PHOTOGRAPHY AS ART </title>
      <para id="import-auto-id1164563033353">Colin Westerbeck of The Art Institute of Chicago argues that "once a medium is no longer essential as a culture's source of information, it turns into an art form."<sup>5</sup> Thus, the death of the picture magazine, according to Westerbeck, marked the end of the power of photography as a mass medium and of the partnership between journalism and art. It was not mere coincidence, he says, that after this development there was a rise in the number of photography galleries, the number of art school degrees in photography, and auction prices for vintage prints—portents of the historical consciousness with which the medium is now appreciated. But as early as the 1840s, when some photographers were expressing dismay over the lack of resolution in William Henry Fox Talbot's calotype process, others were seeing it as a virtue—an aesthetic creation that only the camera could produce. Throughout the history of photography, there has been the realization that the camera and developing lab were capable of yielding much more than a faithful rendition of the visible world. In the hands of imaginative and sensitive photographers, they offered the possibility for creating a unique art form.</para>

One of the most famous of these allegorical photographs, "The Two Ways of Life," created by Swedish photographer Oscar G. Rejlander, was purchased by Queen Victoria, herself an amateur photographer.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1164562411377">The allegorical movement eventually gave way to <emphasis effect="bold">pictorialism</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">an attempt to use the camera for subjective expression</emphasis>. In 1889, an Englishman, Peter Henry Emerson, a leading advocate of the pictorial approach, published <emphasis effect="italics">Naturalistic Photography for Students of the Art</emphasis>, a book that had a profound influence on American as well as English photographers. Emerson rejected the artificiality of the allegorical mode and called for a new aesthetic based on simple equipment and a soft-focus technique. He urged photographers to strive for an impression of nature rather than a literal description of it—in other words, to allow the camera to function as a human eye instead of a mechanical device. In part, Emerson was trying to reconcile the difference between science and art. He believed that if a photograph was nothing more than the product of an optical image striking a light-sensitive surface, it was science. If, on the other hand, it involved the subjective expression of the photographer and presented ideas, it was art.</para><para id="import-auto-id1164561727393"><emphasis effect="bold">BYLINE | </emphasis>There has been a long-standing debate about whether photography is an art or a craft.

        <para id="import-auto-id1164560015885">Emerson's writings, including his own rejection of what he had said earlier, sparked heated controversy on both sides of the Atlantic. In 1902, an American splinter group of pictorialists formed the Photo-Secession organization. Led by Alfred Stieglitz and Edward Steichen, Photo-Secession was a result of the frustration over a lack of standards in American photographic exhibitions. Stieglitz and Steichen advocated new subject matter and new approaches to photography and sought to emphasize its relationship to other arts. In 1905, they set up a gallery at 291 Fifth Avenue in New York known as "291." Along with photographs, they exhibited sculptures, drawings, and lithographs of other artists—especially artists like Matisse, Picasso, and Cezanne, who were part of the avant-garde of <emphasis effect="bold">modernism</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">an artistic movement that attempted a self-conscious break with the past and a search for new forms</emphasis>.

Influenced by the ideas of <emphasis effect="bold">dadaism</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">a movement in art and literature that rejected traditional art values</emphasis>, he created abstract works called "Rayograms"—similar in concept to the photograms produced during the earliest days of photographic experimentation. During this period, three of America's most famous photographers—Paul Strand, Edward Weston, and Ansel Adams—began developing a new aesthetic based on the notions of honesty, directness, and objectivity of expression. Strand, a protegé of Stieglitz, became known for his extreme close-ups of machines and large-scale details of natural objects such as cobwebs, driftwood, and plants. His photographs of the people and landscapes of the Southwest had a serene, lyrical quality. Strand wanted photographers to free themselves from the influence of other arts and to recognize the camera's unique aesthetic.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1164561414105">Edward Weston was fascinated by the geometric configuration of natural forms. Unimpressed by the self-conscious manipulation of experimentalists like Man Ray, Weston strived for a precise rendition of his subject:

Following in the footsteps of early landscape photographers like William Henry Jackson and Timothy H. O'Sullivan, Adams specialized in pictures of mountains and deserts of the West.

But even photographers of that period who were not persuaded to confine themselves solely to social observation or reportage were profoundly influenced by what they had lived through and witnessed. Ansel Adams, for instance, compiled a photographic essay, <emphasis effect="italics">Born Free and Equal</emphasis>, in which he depicted the Manzanar War Relocation Camp, which housed American citizens of Japanese descent.

The so-called "street photography" of the 1950s and 1960s—a style characterized by rough, grainy pictures, often of ordinary people on the streets—was a bridge between the lingering effects of World War II and the social upheaval in American cities two decades later. Later trends, such as conceptual art and pop art, challenged assumptions of what art was supposed to be. Andy Warhol, one of the best known of the artists who selected popular culture as their subject matter, referred to his studio as "The Factory"—an acknowledgment of his consumer-goods approach to the production of art. Postmodernist artists, aware of our dependence on media as a source of reality, have recycled and reconstructed existing photographs as a way of expressing their disenchantment with the influence of mass culture—and even with photography itself.</para><para id="import-auto-id1164562913217">Today, artistic approaches to photography are as varied as photographers themselves. Color, once considered the province of advertising agencies and fashion magazines, has gained greater respectability in artistic photography. Joel Meyerowitz, William Eggleston, and Helen Levitt are just a few of the photographers who helped establish color as a separate genre for landscape and street photography. Composite photographs, like those of Chuck Close, have also received a great deal of attention—partly because of the influence of digitized, computer-generated images of space exploration. At times, the personalities of the artists—like Warhol and Gilbert and George—have overshadowed their works. And, as is the case in every generation, some works—like those of Robert Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano—have caused public outcries and calls for censorship. All of these developments add up to an art form that is alive and flourishing—stretching our imaginations, shocking our sensibilities, and impressing upon us the deeper meanings of our existence.</para>

The major interest of manufacturers in recent years has been in the development of electronic camera and prepress systems and electronic darkrooms. These technologies offer new ways to record, process, store, assemble, and deliver photographs. Some of the newest still cameras, like the Canon Xapshot, record images on a videodisc much like a video camera and play them back on a television screen. The merging of still and video technologies provides the opportunity to take 35-millimeter pictures, view them immediately, and, if necessary, transmit them instantly by telephone line or satellite to a waiting newsroom. Associated Press recently switched from wirephoto receivers to electronic darkrooms as a means of delivering pictures to newspapers. Instead of sorting through a stack of photographic prints, photo editors who subscribe to AP can now call up digitally delivered pictures on a computer screen.</para>

The development of electronic prepress systems—digital electronic graphics and pagination, and electronic phototypesetters called imagesetters—may one day replace the halftone process as a way of getting pictures into print. The new equipment scans photographs electronically and then stores them. Before the photos are incorporated electronically into the page makeup and sent to press, they can be retouched and corrected for color—a capability that photojournalists may view with considerable skepticism.</para><para id="import-auto-id1164563667323">Future missions into outer space will also extend the frontiers of photographic technology, as manufacturers develop ever more powerful lenses to peer into the star-studded darkness of the universe.

      <title>THE WORLD OF PHOTOGRAPHY: A SUMMARY</title>
      <para id="import-auto-id1164563928180">The first pictorial mass medium to be developed was photography. A though human beings had tried for thousands of years to communicate through pictures the world they encountered, it was not until the development of photography just over a hundred and fifty years ago that they could do so with such great fidelity. Discoveries in physics and chemistry, which capitalized on earlier observations about the ways in which sunlight could be used, paved the way for the invention of the camera and a means of making a permanent recording of the image formed by the camera's lens.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1164561696398">L. J. M. Daguerre invented the first practical system of producing permanent pictures, which he called daguerreotypes. Daguerre sold his invention to the French government in 1839, the date that marks the beginning of photography. Because they were inexpensive and relatively easy to produce, daguerreotypes led to the development of a commercial photography industry. Other inventors—notably William Henry Fox Talbot, Frederick Scott Archer, and Richard L. Maddox—made various improvements upon Daguerre's system. By the 1870s, it was possible to make multiple copies of pictures—a necessary step for the development of a true mass medium—and to store negatives and develop them at a later time.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1164561175380">In the latter part of the nineteenth century, photographers concentrated their efforts on capturing "the look of things." Portrait photography, landscape photography, and documentary photography became the major provinces for the new medium. Mathew Brady began as a portrait photographer but later turned his attention to documenting the Civil War. After the war, many photographers, like William Henry Jackson, used their cameras to explore the western United States.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-id2768800">Amateur photography became popular when George Eastman invented an easy-to-use camera and provided a service for processing film. The Kodak box camera and film, introduced in 1888, sold for $25. The Brownie, which followed it some twelve years later, sold for only $1. While some amateurs delved into all aspects of photography, joining photo clubs and subscribing to photo magazines, most were content if the snapshots they took simply turned out.</para><para id="import-auto-id1164562891320">Long before the invention of the halftone photograph, magazines and newspapers tried to illustrate their stories. Sketch artists often supplied drawings of the important activities of the day, and from these drawings, wood engravings were made that could then be printed. The halftone made it possible to print directly from a photograph and gave rise to a new form of photography—photojournalism.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-id1164563995798">Some photojournalists, like Jacob Riis and Lewis Hine, used their cameras as tools for social reform, while others, like Jimmy Hare and Arthur Fellig, stoked the fires of "yellow journalism" with exciting pictures of combat and crime. The use of halftone photographs led to the development of a new type of newspaper-the tabloid-which made its debut in 1919. About the same time, news organizations formed specialized photo operations to service their newspaper clients. In 1935, Associated Press started a wirephoto service. With the introduction of smaller, lightweight cameras, photojournalists were able to take candid shots of their subjects. Eric Salomon of Germany, the first to describe his work as photojournalism, became a leader in the "candid camera" style of photography.</para><para id="import-auto-id7274530">In 1936, publisher Henry R.

Much of the photographic work of this period was carried out by the historical unit of the Farm Security Administration, a New Deal agency set up to tackle the problems caused by poverty, depleted farm land, and the flood of migrant workers who made their way to California.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-id5570535">War clouds in Europe and the Pacific also attracted the attention of photographers, many of whom later risked their lives to tell the story of a world at war. Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Capa, and Margaret Bourke-White were just a few of the distinguished World War II photographers who added stature to the field of photojournalism.

      <para id="import-auto-id7327796">Photography as an art form had its roots in allegorical photographs, carefully composed pictures used to tell a story. This movement gave way to pictorialism, an aesthetic that likened the camera to a human eye and attempted to draw a distinction between art and science. In America, pictorialists such as Alfred Stieglitz and Edward Steichen helped establish new standards for photography as art. Man Ray, an American photographer working in Paris, created abstract photographs that he called Rayograms. Meanwhile, Paul Strand, Edward Weston, and Ansel Adams were urging a quite different aesthetic, which emphasized natural shapes and large details. The Great Depression and World War II affected notions about photography, causing some photographers to adopt a documentary approach and others, like Minor White, to use photographs as reflections of inner psychological states.</para><para id="import-auto-id8937879">Recent trends in photographic art include street photography, conceptual and pop art, and postmodernist photography.
