Television has transformed the political life of the nation, has changed the daily habits of our people, has molded the style of the generation, made overnight global phenomena out of local happenings, re-directed the flow of information and values from traditional channels into centralized networks reaching into every home. In other words, it has profoundly affected what we call the process of socialization, the process by which members of our species become human.

      <title>THE DEVELOPMENT OF TELEVISION </title>
      <para id="import-auto-idm1718876528">The dream of seeing at a distance—<emphasis effect="italics">tele-vision</emphasis>—stimulated inventors and speculators for a long time before they were able to convert that dream to reality. Early attempts to realize the dream involved transmitting still pictures by wires, a type of facsimile now used by the news services to send rough reproductions of drawings and photographs to newspapers. Such transmission was demonstrated as early as 1862 by an Italian priest, Abbe Caselli. The development of wireless telegraphy and then radio spurred further efforts to create a practical television system.</para>

        <title>Technological Development</title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1485153952">The major spurt in the development of television technology occurred between World War I and World War II. During this period, the competition was resolved between the advocates of a mechanical system and those favoring an all-electronic system of television. To understand the issue, it is important to realize that any television image must be made up of small bits or dots, analogous to the newspaper photograph or the giant moving pictures in signs on Times Square in New York. Those moving signs on Broadway are made up of hundreds of electric bulbs of different colors. The newspaper photograph, as you can see if you examine it closely, is made up of hundreds of minute light and dark dots. In both cases, the farther away from the image you are, or the smaller and more numerous the dots or light bulbs, the more distinct the image.</para>

One developed by John Baird was demonstrated in Great Britain in 1926. That demonstration sparked a virtual explosion of television activity, befitting the fast and furious speculative days of the late 1920s. Experimental stations went on the air almost immediately in the United States as well as in Britain. RCA's W2XBS was licensed in the United States by the Federal Radio Commission in 1928. In that same year, the General Electric television station in Schenectady, New York, which had begun a regular schedule of broadcasting, experimented with television drama. Because the early television screens were so small and the pictures so fuzzy, the entire play had to be done in close-ups so that the audience could see the actors.</para>

          <title>An all-electronic television system.</title>
          <para id="import-auto-idm251474592">The development of television was seriously hampered by its dependence on a mechanical system for breaking up and reassembling images. Not only was the system too vulnerable to breakdowns, but the quality of images that could be achieved was severely limited. A major leap in the development of television came through the independent efforts of two young geniuses, a Russian immigrant named Vladimir Zworykin, and the self-educated son of a Utah sheep farmer, Philo Farnsworth. These men developed the major ideas and technology needed for breaking up and reassembling a visual image electronically.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm1488838048">Zworykin, who had studied electronics in Russia and France, emigrated to the United States immediately after World War I and found a job doing research for the Westinghouse Electric Company. In Russia he had been involved in some of the earliest experiments with television, and he asked Westinghouse for permission to continue those experiments. This was 1919, and the possibilities for television seemed almost nonexistent, but he received permission. In 1923, Zworykin applied for a patent on an iconoscope tube designed to electronically break up a picture by scanning an image focused on the tube with a beam of electrons. The image was reproduced in very rough form by a type of cathode ray tube. In 1929 Zworykin demonstrated <emphasis effect="italics">a receiving or picture tube that produced higher-fidelity pictures</emphasis>. He called it a <emphasis effect="bold">kinescope tube</emphasis>.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm213153568">Working independently, apparently not even knowing of Zworykin's work, Philo Farnsworth solved the problem of electronic television even sooner. In 1922, he described an all-electronic television system, for which he received two patents in 1930. Zworykin's system was not patented until 1938.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm1724080464">Not surprisingly, the similarity of Farnsworth and Zworykin's television systems resulted in a four-year patent fight, which the court decided in Farnsworth's favor. RCA, for whom Zworykin was then working, agreed to pay Farnsworth $1million for the use of his patents so that both his inventions and those of Zworykin could be used in the manufacture of modern television cameras and receivers. (See Figure 10.3 for a schematic drawing of the early all-electronic television system.)</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm1690254928">The electronic television system simplified the problem of synchronizing the camera and the receiver. It also made possible the breaking down of the image into finer bits, which resulted in better picture quality.</para>

          <title>Technical standards. </title>
          <para id="import-auto-idm250382224">Although solutions were found for the mechanical problems of the early television system, other technical problems plagued the development of the medium. There were disagreements about the standards the industry should adopt: the number of scanning lines per frame, the number of frames per second, whether sound should be AM or FM. More channels were needed for television transmission than the government had allocated. Not enough capital was available for research. Also, businesses and the public were reluctant to invest in either stations or receivers until they were certain the technical standards would not change and make their investment obsolete. The Federal Communications Commission, aided by the <emphasis effect="bold">National Television Systems Committee (NTSC)</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">an advisory group for the industry and the FCC</emphasis>, worked on these problems throughout the 1940s. By 1948, it had become necessary for the FCC to impose a freeze on new license applications. The freeze lasted four years while the FCC wrestled with a host of difficult issues. Finally, in 1952, the commissioners made some critical decisions that have shaped television developments ever since.</para><list id="import-auto-idm195474848" list-type="enumerated" number-style="arabic">
            <item>They added 70 new channels in the UHF (ultra-high-frequency) band to the 12 VHF channels being used up to that time by television stations. This made possible many more television stations in all parts of the country.</item>
            <item>They added an all-electronic color system as the standard that would be compatible with existing black and white receivers, thus facilitating and speeding the conversion of television to color.</item>
            <item>They solved the problem of stations interfering with each other by increasing the geographic separation of stations that used the same channel.</item>
            <item>They reserved channels for 242 stations distributed throughout the country for noncommercial, educational purposes.</item>
          </list>
          <para id="import-auto-idm1718562224">It is important to recognize the implications of these decisions made by the FCC, just as it is important to recognize the implications of any decision by a government regulatory agency, even a decision not to regulate something. The decisions concerning color meant that RCA would make more money and CBS would make less, since the standards adopted were those RCA developed. The CBS color system was rejected. Adding UHF channels meant more competition for the VHF commercial channels—competition for viewers and for advertising dollars. The addition of those extra channels also made the reservation of 242 station licenses for educational purposes politically feasible. If the additional 70 UHF channels had not been made available, commercial interests would probably have killed the chances for educational reservations, because the pressure of individuals and corporations wanting to start new commercial stations during this period was quite intense. It took still another FCC ruling in 1962 to make UHF economically viable. That year the FCC began requiring that all new television receivers have UHF as well as VHF capacity.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm218228576">Another important, although indirect, implication of these decisions by the Federal Communications Commission is that no matter how much one might wish for or advocate a totally free-enterprise system, such a system is impossible in a civilized society. Especially in matters related to broadcasting, the public interest, as well as commercial interests, demands a certain amount of orderly government regulation. Otherwise there is chaos, and everyone loses.</para>

How do you think technical standards for television, the expansion in the number of channels, and the development of noncommercial television stations could have occurred without government involvement?</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm194456528">By 1952, when the FCC made those decisions on UHF and color and reserved channels for education, 108 commercially licensed television stations were on the air, and national network service had begun. About 15 million homes were equipped with television receivers.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm1690735488">Within two years after the FCC decisions, the number of television stations in the country had more than tripled, and 122 of the new stations were on the UHF band. Three of the new stations were noncommercial. The growth since then has not been as rapid, but it has been steady. More than fourteen hundred television stations are now on the air in this country, almost half of them UHF. About one-fourth of the total are noncommercial, educational, or "public" stations. This number far exceeds the 242 that were reserved for educational purposes in 1952.</para></section>
        <section id="import-auto-idm210735280">
          <title>Color.</title>
          <para id="import-auto-idm1855951296">With the decision that the all electronic color system would be the standard for the American television system, the push for color began in earnest. The major pushers were NBC and its parent corporation, RCA, since they held the major patents on the electronic color system and had the most to gain. NBC mounted its first season of color programming in 1954-1955, but not until the mid-1960s did color television become generally accepted by all broadcasters and the public. The cost of television receivers and of converting local stations to color, coupled with the probable reluctance of ABC and CBS to promote color because it would contribute to the profits of NBC and RCA, slowed its development for a decade. Despite the high costs and the heel-dragging of ABC and CBS, by the late sixties television was virtually all color. Black-and-white (monochrome) television in the United States was little more than a memory.</para>

          <title>The transition from live television to videotape. </title>
          <para id="import-auto-idm201268688">The other major change in television in the 1950s and 1960s was the decline of live entertainment programming and the general acceptance of film and videotape. One of the exciting aspects of television during the "Golden Era," from the late 1940s to the mid-1950s, was the fact that most of it was broadcast live. Viewers of variety shows and dramas were not surprised to see the shadow of a microphone boom move across the face of performers or to catch a quick glimpse of a stagehand out of place in a Shakespearean scene. Scripts were written and settings were designed to facilitate the quick movement of actors from one scene to another, often with a change of costume on the way. Some nostalgia buffs believe that much of the excitement of television was lost with the decline of live television.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm1531001520">Until the late 1950s, almost all of the major television programs were produced in New York. As the industry began prerecording the programs—both to reduce the probability of errors and to facilitate reruns, syndication to nonnetwork stations, and sales of programs overseas—the center of entertainment production shifted to Hollywood. No other city in the world had the facilities and the vast number of professionals skilled in the making of motion pictures, whether for theater showing or for showing on this upstart medium, television.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm229598448">The move to Hollywood was hardly complete before the new videotape technology was sufficiently developed that it began to replace film. Videotape, introduced by the Ampex Corporation in 1956, had a number of advantages over film; for example, it combined most of the speed of live television production (at least if frequent retakes were unnecessary) with the editing and replay possibilities of film.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm198476352">The transition from live television to film and videotaped television programming occurred in less than a decade. Between 1955 and 1970, the amount of live network programming declined from 87 to 15 percent. Today, news, sports, and other special events are virtually the only live programming on the networks. Most of the remainder is videotaped or shot on film.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm1518325088"><emphasis effect="bold">REVIEW |</emphasis> In order to increase the number of channels available for television, the Federal Communications Commission in 1952 authorized use of the UHF frequency band to complement the 12 channels in the VHF band. The commission reserved channels for 242 noncommercial stations and decided upon a color system compatible with black and white. The introduction of videotape in the 1950s brought an end to most live programming.</para>

        <para id="import-auto-idm208087504">Except for its technological aspects, television's development in this country was totally different from that of any other medium. Every other medium required a long period of search or exploration to discover its role in the society and its mode of operation. When each medium first came along, no one was certain what it was suited for and how it could be operated best. This was not the case with television. Almost from its inception, it was fit into an existing mold, the mold shaped by radio.</para>

</media></para><para id="import-auto-idm1529999872">Because television was developed and promoted primarily by companies that developed radio, it was conceived simply as radio with pictures. Thus, the programming, the economic structure, and even the pattern of regulation, that existed for radio were adopted virtually without change for television. Not only did we get the same kinds of soap operas, variety shows, audience participation shows, situation comedies, news programs, police and detective series, westerns, sports and talk shows; we also got television versions of precisely the same programs in some cases. Television commercials were sold in the same way as radio commercials and were distributed between and within programs in the same way. Both the self-regulatory code of the National Association of Broadcasters and the governmental regulations of the Federal Communications Commission that were developed for radio were applied to television.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm215350736">It probably seems natural to you that television was cast in radio's mold. It certainly seemed so to most of those who were involved in the visual medium during its developmental period because they worked for radio stations and networks. However, this was not the only way in which television could have been shaped. If it had been developed and nurtured by persons other than those involved in radio, it may have been conceived in different ways-, thus becoming quite a different medium today.</para>

In each of these cases, how would television differ from what we have today?</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1721075824">You ought to think about the questions in the preceding Byline item, not because television is likely to change at this late date, but because it may help you see future communication developments in some new ways. As new media not yet even dreamed of come along, keep in mind this lesson of television. Assuming you are in any way involved in these new developments, as you may well be, remember: Any medium can be conceived of in a great variety of ways. Do not let yourself be stampeded into thinking about a medium in the same way everyone else does. Instead, see how great a variety of other ways you can find to conceive it and explore the implications of each of those conceptions. In this way you may discover far better ways to use each medium.</para>

        <title>The Structure of the U.S. Television Industry</title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1716777168">The television system in this country has three primary components: local stations, networks, and cable systems. There are two major kinds of television stations, and networks: commercial and noncommercial. And we also should include as part of the television industry the rapidly growing field of industrial television, or corporate video communications.</para>
        <section id="import-auto-idm1726867760">
          <title>Local stations. </title>
          <para id="import-auto-idm1495737056">Theoretically, the local station is the heart of the American broadcasting system, as defined by the Communications Act of 1934. The part of broadcasting that is regulated is the local channel or frequency. The licensee—the individual or group that receives a license from the FCC—has the legal responsibility for everything coming out of the station's transmitter, whether originated locally or by a network. (The only exception to this legal responsibility is material from a bona fide political candidate. Stations are forbidden from censoring anything that a political candidate says. Hence, they are not legally responsible if a candidate says something libelous over the air.) In a sense, this notion of local licensee responsibility for everything broadcast is an anachronism in this era of network dominance, but it remains the law.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm255276512">Most local commercial stations are affiliated with one of the national networks. Such network affiliation provides several advantages. The primary advantage is that a network provides the local stations with entertainment programming, news, and public affairs programs, which attract a larger audience than local programs would do, and which no local station could afford on its own. For example, no local stations could afford a news bureau in Washington with two hundred to three hundred fifty staff members like the one each network maintains.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm1497655888">Only about 5 to 10 percent of the programming on the average network-affiliated commercial station is locally produced. About 65 percent of the programs come from the network, and between 25 and 30 percent come from <emphasis effect="italics">independent program suppliers</emphasis> called <emphasis effect="bold">syndicators</emphasis>. Even these syndicated programs are often programs that were formerly on a network, such as "M*A*S*H," "Happy Days," "Miami Vice," and "Dukes of Hazzard." Many of the old movies that you see on television also come to stations through syndication. The local station fully controls the content of only that 5 to 10 percent that it produces. However, as indicated before, the station licensee is also legally responsible for all the rest.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm207450480">The local station benefits from its network affiliation generally because the network programs attract larger audiences to the station. Therefore, the station can charge more for the programs and commercials that it sells locally and to national spot advertisers who buy time on individual stations. In addition, the local stations get some income from carrying the network-produced programs.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm225267248">Each station that is part of a national commercial network has an affiliation contract, unless it is an "O &amp; O" station—one owned and operated by the network. This contract assures both the network and the station of certain benefits:</para><list id="import-auto-idm222922464" list-type="enumerated" number-style="arabic">
            <item>The network is assured that the station will carry most network programs at certain times if the network wants it to do so. The network needs this "option time" from its affiliates so it can promise an advertiser that a program and its commercials will be seen on a particular number of stations and in the markets the advertiser wants.</item>
            <item>Stations are assured that they will get a certain percentage of their standard charge (their rate card) for time devoted to most sponsored network programs or commercials. That amount is generally about 30 percent of what they would get if they sold the time locally for one of their own programs. For programs such as sports, news, and late? night programs like "The Tonight Show," instead of getting payment from the network, a station might be given a certain number of advertising slots within each program that it can sell for commercials. The station thus keeps all income produced during its slots, while the network keeps all income from the advertising it sells for its slots. In addition, the networks do not share the income they derive from the first 24 hours of prime-time programming an affiliate carries each month. Presumably, in this way affiliates pay their share of the networks' overhead costs.</item>

In conjunction with production companies, these networks produce or cause to be produced most of the programming transmitted in prime time (7:30 P.M. to 11:00 P.M. on the coasts, 6:30 P.M. to 10:00 P.M. in the Mid? west.) This is the time during which television normally has its largest audiences.</para>

In one season, for example, NBC reported that it considered more than one hundred fifty actual scripts.

          <para id="import-auto-idm1487647472">In much the same way that ABC struggled to gain parity with the older networks NBC and CBS, Fox has battled the big three commercial networks with innovative programming and aggressive marketing. Since its debut in 1986, Fox has steadily increased its market share and number of affiliates. A part of the Rupert Murdoch media empire, which includes the 20th Century Fox production company, Fox gave NBC quite a scare at the beginning of the 1990 season when its first original episode of "The Simpsons" finished only one-tenth of a rating point behind the first new episode of its head-on competition, "The Cosby Show." The 18.4 rating—the percent of the audience tuned to "The Simpsons"—was the best ever for the animated cartoon, and the 29 share-the percent of the viewing audience tuned to the program—was the highest ever for a Fox series. These figures are even more remarkable in that Fox has far fewer affiliates than NBC, most of them independent stations on UHF channels. While most of its prime-time programs still finish last in the ratings, two other Fox series that have fared well in ratings competition are "Married... With Children" and "In Living Color." To expand its potential audience, Fox recently signed an agreement with Tele-Communications, Inc., to furnish programming to cable systems located in areas that did not have a Fox outlet, thereby making cable systems network affiliates. Fox soon plans to increase its prime-time programming from five to six nights a week and to launch an hour-long national newscast.</para><para id="import-auto-idm1492054912">Each commercial network today, or any other company, can own 12 television stations, so long as the total coverage area does not include more than 25 percent of the population of the country.

          <title>Cable systems. </title>
          <para id="import-auto-idm245064640">The third element in the American television industry is cable. The cable industry began in a few communities that had no local television stations and, because of their geography or distance from towns with stations, could not receive television signals very well. Some entrepreneur would find a high hill near town and install on it a very tall antenna that could receive distant television signals. These signals were amplified and then piped by telephone cable to each home whose inhabitants were willing to pay a monthly fee. These were called Community Antenna Television Systems, or CATV. Unlike over-the-air television, which came into the home by way of an antenna, cable television came by way of wire-much like the telephone. From these rather humble beginnings a multi-billion-dollar cable industry arose.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm1724831680">Cable systems are no longer primarily for communities that do not have their own stations. Because of their ability to provide many different channels through a single wire, the better quality of color most homes get with cable, and the availability of a wide variety of programming to fill those channels, cable systems have emerged as a major television industry, one that rivals over-the-air broadcasting. At present, there are some 50 million subscribers to cable television, and that figure is likely to grow as the number of homes receiving cable increases from the current 56 percent. Cable networks—that is, networks created to provide programming to cable systems—are almost as well known as the older commercial networks. Some of the more popular cable networks are CNN, ESPN, MTV, HBO, and QVC.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm1498304752">Cable has one indisputable advantage over traditional over-the-air broadcasting stations: it is many "stations" rolled into one-including the over-the-air stations. So long as the viewer watches any one cable channel, he or she is part of the cable audience. But the over-the-air broadcaster has only one channel to program-one chance to capture an audience at any particular time. The cable operator, by contrast, can offer at any one moment news, comedy, music video, weather, shopping information, religious programming, programming for children—an array of services restricted only by the number of channels in the system.</para>

</media></para><para id="import-auto-idm211426320">Whereas commercial broadcasters are often reluctant to devote time to public affairs programs—programs that fulfill their public interest obligation but generate little in the way of revenue—cable operators can afford to devote entire channels to public affairs. They can even afford to offer public-access channels—channels available to all the people in the community who think they have something worth transmitting.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm1726775376">It is not uncommon for a company to lease a channel from a cable system and then sell the time to local advertisers who use the company's facilities to produce their own programs—a practice reminiscent of the early days of radio. Many of these low-budget programs allow the viewers to phone in questions. A typical evening's fare might consist of advice from a local garden shop, discussion of legal matters by a local attorney, or health tips from a local physician. Despite their lack of sophistication, programs of this nature have proved valuable to their sponsors, who generate "goodwill" for their products or services. And they have enabled the cable operator to serve the local community-even better perhaps than the over-the-air broadcaster whose air time is filled mainly with network programming.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm1728924192">Congress has expressed concern over the increasing concentration of ownership in the cable industry. Unlike television stations, there is no limit on the number of cable systems one company can own.

</media></para><para id="import-auto-idm1866449744">The manner and extent of cable regulation has been a matter of controversy since the medium's initial development. Through most of its his- tory it has been regulated both by the FCC and the local governments that granted charters for operation. In a few cases, there was also some state regulation. Just as the federal government has reduced its regulation of broadcasting in recent years, it has reduced its regulation of cable. Perhaps more important, it has also reduced the power of local governments to regulate. The Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, passed by Congress and signed by the president, freed cable system owners of almost all local regulation, including the regulation of rates. To no one's surprise, cable rates have increased steadily since that time. The General Accounting Office reported that between 1986 and 1988 rates increased more than 25 percent.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm1810829232">In 1985, the Federal Court of Appeals struck down the "must carry rule," an FCC rule that required cable operators to carry the signals of local television stations. Although the principal trade organizations of the cable and broadcasting industries seem to have reached a compromise on the "must carry" policy, there is still concern on the part of over-the-air broadcasters—particularly UHF broadcasters—that their stations will not be carried on the best (lowest) cable channels. For example, a cable system in Janesville, Wisconsin, announced that it was reassigning four local channels from nearby Rockford, Illinois to Channels 39 to 42. This decision infuriated broadcasters because it relegated local stations to channels that would require a converter to receive. Broadcasters demand not only that cable systems carry the over-the-air stations in their area; they want them carried on Channels 2 to 13, the VHF channels viewers most frequently use.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm1854538992">The fight between cable systems and over-the-air broadcasters is not likely to end soon. Both are in hot competition for viewers. At present, cable seems to be winning the battle. A 1989 Roper poll commissioned by the Television Information Office concluded that the public perceives cable as having better program quality, better children's programs, more educational programs, better entertainment, greater variety, more culture, and more sports. The only bit of good news for over-the-air broadcasters was in news programming. The public thought regular television broadcasters had the edge in this category.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm211340640"><emphasis effect="bold">REVIEW |</emphasis> Local stations, networks, and cable systems are the primary means by which television programming is delivered to the home in this country. Most local stations are affiliated with a network, which supplies much of a station's programming. The major networks are ABC, NBC, CBS, PBS, and Fox. Cable systems offer local channels—including the network affiliates in the area—and many additional channels. Currently, there is heated competition between cable and over-the-air broadcasting.</para>

          <para id="import-auto-idm224909184">As we discussed earlier, in 1952, the Federal Communications Commission produced a revolutionary plan for the development of noncommercial broadcasting in this country. As a result of this plan, 242 television channels were reserved solely for noncommercial licensees—educational institutions, cities and states, and other nonprofit groups that would agree to operate the stations on a noncommercial basis for the best interests of the total community.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm258207984">Educational and other noncommercial radio stations and a few non-commercial television stations had existed before this, but institutions or organizations wanting to start such stations always had to compete with commercial companies for frequencies and channels.

          <para id="import-auto-idm259082496">After the FCC reserved channels for public broadcasting stations, Congress set aside money that could be awarded to institutions or groups to help them get their stations on the air or improve their facilities.

          <para id="import-auto-idm200893744">There are now four major types of public television stations:</para>

            <item>Those owned and operated by colleges or universities; such as the stations at the Universities of Houston, Wisconsin, and Southern Illinois.</item>
            <item>Noncommercial stations owned and operated by school systems, common throughout the country.</item>
            <item>Those owned and operated by state or municipal authorities. Generally the licensee is a state agency that has responsibility for a group of stations, as in Georgia, New Jersey, and Iowa. In New York City, the city government owns and operates a television station.</item>
            <item>Public television stations developed and operated by nonprofit corporations organized specifically for that purpose. Among the best of these stations are the ones in San Francisco, Boston, New York, and Chicago.</item>
          </list>
          <para id="import-auto-idm197239568">Getting adequate operating funds is a constant problem for most non-commercial stations. In addition to funds from the federal government, some stations obtain funds from the general tax revenues of a city or state, from gifts of individuals and foundations, and from selling time and services to public school systems and other agencies. Some school systems, for example, pay a certain amount to a public station for every child in the system in exchange for the station carrying educational programs designed for in-school use. One of the more controversial forms of financing for public television stations is the underwriting of programs by large corporations. Critics charge that the on-the-air credits given to the underwriters are the same as advertising and hence should not be permitted on a noncommercial station. More serious is the fear of some that such underwriting will give these corporations the same power to influence programming on public television that they have over commercial television.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm1531233376">Another hotly debated issue concerning noncommercial television is whether public stations and the public broadcasting network should pursue as large an audience as possible. Those opposed to such a pursuit believe the ·purpose of public broadcasting should be to serve specialized audiences with material not available on commercial television. They reason that anything that attracts a mass audience will ultimately find its way onto commercial television. Those on the other side argue that they have a responsibility to bring the benefits of public television to as many people as possible.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm242597648">A third issue, argued primarily within the public broadcasting fraternity, is how control of programming of public stations should be distributed between the national network and the local management. Until recently, stations pooled their programming funds and bid on the programs they wanted PBS to carry. This was known as the Station Program Cooperative. But under a new National Program Plan, the network gained responsibility for the vast majority of programming decisions.</para>

In the system of broadcasting that currently predominates in this and other countries, some individual or group of individuals must be the final arbiter for any particular channel, deciding what will be transmitted. In this country, a number of these groups share control for our commercial television system, with the general public indirectly holding a great deal of programming power.</para>

          <title>The role of programming personnel. </title>
          <para id="import-auto-idm1707850928">In one sense, network and local station programmers have the major say about what will and will not be transmitted. Their dominant criterion is generally what most people will watch, or at least most of the kinds of people who are potential purchasers of advertised products. The reason for this is obvious: station and network programmers want to maximize profits, and the way to maximize profits in broadcasting generally is to get the largest possible audience and to keep it. Advertisers will then want their commercials on that station or network and will be willing to pay large prices for that privilege. Thus, every time you turn the television set on or change channels, you are voting on the kinds of programs you want on the air. If enough people vote the way you do, that behavior will influence the ratings, and your "vote" will be heard. In a sense, it is a highly democratic system; the majority rules. However, it is not perfectly democratic. As indicated elsewhere, if you are between the ages of 20 and 55 and are in a sufficiently high socioeconomic class, your vote carries more weight.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm201299920">Another important determinant of what gets on the air is the program producer or the person with program ideas. It is impossible for station and network personnel to produce most of the programs they carry, and even if they could, they would not have enough ideas for that many programs. All they can do most of the time is to select from among what other individuals and companies make available. Nothing can get on the air until someone conceives of it as a television program. That seems obvious, but it is a point too often ignored by critics of television. Many people criticize what is on the air; few have ideas for practical alternatives.</para>

At first glance, this seems an ideal system. Why should anyone be unhappy with it?</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm256401456">The principal reason why some people are unhappy with this system is that it does not work as neatly as our description has suggested. First, it is not totally a free-enterprise system; secondly, the system does not serve audiences with minority interests and tastes nearly as well as it serves the majority audience.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm258146176">It is not entirely a free enterprise system because not everyone who wishes to start a television station, or even a cable system or channel, can do so. Far more individuals or groups want a station than there are channels available in the portion of the spectrum set aside for regular television. Hence, competition is reduced; in many markets only a few stations are vying for audience attention.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm1821349824">The second problem may be more serious. Because the economic situation motivates stations and networks to try for the largest possible audiences almost all of the time, individuals who want information or entertainment of the sort that does not interest a very large number of other people tend to go unsatisfied. For example, you may like a type of music or drama or information that vast numbers of other people do not like. Because the audience for such programs is so small, it is not profitable for a station to broadcast them. The national networks are generally not interested in a program that can attract only 10 or 20 million people. This is an important reason for government regulation_-to force stations to provide some service for those whose interests are not shared by the majority. This is also an important reason for an alternative broadcasting system, a public or noncommercial system that is guided by criteria other than popularity so that it provides alternatives to programs aimed at the majority audience.</para>

        <para id="import-auto-idm193307888">The alternative broadcasting system and the limited government regulation that we have in this country do not satisfy all of the critics of American broadcasting. Some are unhappy not only with the important role played by commercial interests in determining programs and program content, but also with the important role played by the majority audience. These critics do not believe the majority of the audience should have so much say about what programs are on the air. They use two primary arguments to support that belief. First, they claim that if the public has free choice, most people will select only programs they are familiar with and can easily appreciate. These critics believe audiences must occasionally be put in a position in which they have little choice but to view other sorts of programs so they will learn to appreciate them. In this view, learning to appreciate more complex forms of entertainment ("high" art) and information (such as documentaries or more detailed news programs) takes time and experience. Taste for such programs does not come naturally; it is acquired. Such critics say that if the audience has a free choice it will continue to avoid “good” programs and so will never acquire that taste.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1493734240"><emphasis effect="bold">REVIEW |</emphasis> There is much debate over who should control the content of television programming. Our commercial system is such that, for the most part, audience size dictates the type of programming likely to air, although critics charge that giving the public what it wants reduces the chances for quality programming and limits the audience's choices.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm245492416">The second argument against giving the public what it wants is the elitist argument that the public simply does not know what is good for it. Interestingly, this argument comes from not only the traditional elitists, those who turn up their noses at the "common folks" and "common tastes," but also from many of those who claim to be fighting for these common folks. Many leaders of the political left believe the media must primarily serve social and political ends. They also believe they know better than the masses what content and style will serve those ends. (Keep in mind, though, that these arguments have been greatly simplified here.)</para>

        <title>The Role of the Network in Determining Content</title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1515346864">As television developed in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, a major change from the pattern of broadcasting set by radio was the shift in control of prime-time programs from the advertiser and advertising agency to the networks.</para>
        <section id="import-auto-idm1730896608">
          <title>The shift in program control from advertiser to network. </title>
          <para id="import-auto-idm219669952">Initially, television followed the radio pattern of having each program sponsored and largely controlled by a single advertiser. As television became more expensive, however, few advertisers could cover all the costs of a program. In addition, as television became more competitive, networks wanted greater control of both the scheduling and content of programs so they could compete more effectively. They recognized that they needed to be concerned with more than simply the content of each program; they had to plan each entire evening as a package, since each program on a network affects the audience for the program that follows. Further, each network generally wanted the entire schedule for any given evening to attract and hold a particular kind of audience, one that would be lucrative to sell to advertisers. Because of these concerns, networks sometimes refused to carry certain programs, even though a sponsor wanted them, because they did not attract a large enough audience or the right kind of audience. Broadcasters wanted audiences in the 20-to-40 age bracket primarily, audiences of those individuals who are upwardly mobile and, therefore, more frequent purchasers of most products. In the early 1970s, CBS dropped several of its most popular programs—"Beverly Hillbillies," "Green Acres," and "Petticoat Junction"—because they were attracting too many older, rural viewers—those with less purchasing power.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm259684128">Programming a network became an art, and to practice the art properly required total control. For example, in the mid-1970s, when the ABC television network first began challenging seriously the dominance of NBC and CBS for the prime-time audience, it made major gains for the entire week with just five popular programs. It built its entire schedule around these programs, broadcasting one of them each weeknight at 7:00 P.M. central time. The plan, as the network's president put it, was to "control the center," with those five programs strung across the center of the weekday evenings like a fishing net. Those programs caught a sizable portion of the audience and held them for the rest of the evening. Devising strategies of this sort to attract attention and to counter the strategies of the other networks has become a highly refined art, and programming executives with talent for this art are eagerly sought.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm224393152">Networks wanted and got not only more control of programming, but also a share of the ownership of most series they broadcast, no matter who had developed and produced them. The reason for this was that the networks wanted to protect their investments and ensure greater profits. Putting a new series on the air entailed certain risks and considerable costs. Ample promotion was needed to increase the probability of success. Each failed series reduced the audience for the programs that followed. The risks were more acceptable if the potential for profit was greater. By sharing ownership, a network got that greater potential for profit. With a share of ownership came a share of the profit from the network rerun rights for successful programs, syndication of a series to other stations after its network run was completed, and sales to stations and networks in other countries.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm227051648">These practices were so profitable that by 1968 the networks were sharing this way in the control and profits of over 80 percent of the prime-time programs they broadcast, even though those programs ostensibly were made by "independent" producers. An additional 16 percent were produced directly by the network. This left only slightly over 3 percent being produced by totally independent producers.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm258052816"><emphasis effect="bold">BYLINE |</emphasis> Where do you stand on the issue of who determines programs and program content? Should broadcasters be forced to program some material for people with minority tastes, even though the audience will be relatively small? Should broadcasters be pressured to program some material that might expand or extend your taste and ours, rather than just programming material that most of us already like?</para>

        <title>Reducing the Power of the Networks</title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1496137440">The Federal Communications Commission feared that these network practices were reducing competition and hence limiting the diversity of programming. Therefore, in 1970, the FCC passed the <emphasis effect="bold">Financial Interest and Syndication Rules</emphasis>—<emphasis effect="italics">rules prohibiting the networks from acquiring partial ownership or syndication rights of programs created by independent producers</emphasis>.<sup>1</sup> They could buy rights only for network showing. In addition, the antitrust division of the U.S. Justice Department reduced network control further by forcing the major commercial networks to limit the production of their own prime-time entertainment programming to a maximum of two and one-half hours per week. Since that time, the networks have pressed hard for relaxation of the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules—and for a very good reason. When the FCC adopted the rules, the three major commercial networks accounted for 90 percent of the television audience and were practically the sole buyers of programming. Today the networks hold only 60 percent of the audience, and programs are purchased by scores of cable systems and independent stations, and by the networks' newest rival, Fox Broadcasting.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1479882560">The major opposition to changing the so-called "fin-syn" rules has been the movie industry, which until recently lobbied successfully to maintain its stake in the syndication market, a market expected to grow to $10.6 billion by 1995. In the early 1990s, the eight largest motion picture studios controlled 63 percent of the domestic syndication market and 80 percent of the overseas market and supplied more than 70 percent of the network programs aired in prime time. Instead of promoting competition, the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules appeared to do nothing more than shift control from the networks to the major Hollywood studios. This change in the marketplace—along with a change in the ownership of the studios, four of which had fallen into foreign hands—prompted the FCC to repeal a portion of the rules. In a 1991 decision that seemed to please no one, the FCC voted 3 to 2 to allow the networks to acquire foreign syndication rights to programs they air and to syndicate domestically programs they produce in-house. But it limited the number of in-house productions to 40 percent of the prime-time schedule and placed restrictions on the manner in which foreign syndication could be carried out. The FCC exempted Fox from any restrictions on syndication until it exceeds 15 hours of prime-time programming a week. The new rulings fall short of the total repeal the networks had hoped for and are likely to be tested in federal court by the networks and the Hollywood studios.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1534753568"><emphasis effect="bold">REVIEW |</emphasis> At one time, advertisers exerted a great deal of influence over programming, but gradually the networks gained control. Today, much of a station's programming—especially prime-time programming—is determined by the networks. To reduce the power of networks, the FCC passed the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules prohibiting them from retaining rights to independently produced programs. The Justice Department further restricted network control by limiting the number of prime-time programs they could produce. In 1991, the FCC modified the rerun rules so that networks could acquire financial rights to some syndicated programs. Because of competition among networks, cable stations, and local stations, the rights to certain types of programming—such as sports—have increased substantially.</para>

          <title>Network competition. </title>
          <para id="import-auto-idm1497324608">Perhaps partly because of this battle over sources of entertainment programming, some of the competition among networks shifted to sports, news, and public affairs programming in the past few years. Consequently, the price of rights to broadcast sports events and the salaries and other expenditures for news and public affairs rose dramatically. In 1989, CBS, ABC, NBC, and ESPN paid some $531 million dollars for the rights to carry National Football League games. What worries traditional networks and over-the-air broadcasters is the increasing number of sporting events that are being sold to cable networks.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm220848544">Competition among stations and networks in covering the news was once based on the assumption that having outstanding news programs added to one's prestige. This is still an important motivator, but to it has been added a second motivator: the profitability of news and public affairs programs for the network and local station. Not only are news programs drawing large audiences; they are drawing audiences composed largely of mature viewers with above-average expendable incomes.</para>

        <title>Self-Regulation of Television</title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1714466880">For many years the television industry had a formal system of self-regulation, just as most other major mass communication industries do. The main element in that system was the Television Code of the National Association of Broadcasters. The code stressed in general terms the responsibilities of television broadcasters, set general standards on various types of content, and limited the amount of advertising that should be permitted during any given hour. Each network also has its own code.</para>

        <para id="import-auto-idm194367824">Although you might argue with a few specific points in the code, you probably agree with most of them. The same is true of almost all viewers. Nevertheless, the National Association of Broadcasters has dropped the code, and for a surprising reason: not because broadcasters were unhappy with it, but because the federal government attacked it!</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1481562640">The attack was instigated by a group of advertisers who charged that the agreement among broadcasters to limit commercial advertising illegally restrained trade. As a result, the Justice Department filed suit against the NAB in 1979, charging it to be in violation of antitrust laws. It cited three provisions of the code in the suit: its limit on the number of products or services that could be advertised in a single short commercial, its limit on the amount of time that could be devoted to commercials during any one hour, and its limit on the number of times programs could be interrupted for commercials. The Justice Department said, in effect, that these provisions were analogous to an agreement among the major manufacturers of automobiles or other products to limit production in order to keep prices high, instead of permitting competition to bring about lower prices.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm209990240">In March 1982, the district court in Washington, D.C., ordered the NAB to stop enforcing the first of those provisions until further notice and said the entire suit would be settled by trial. Instead of fighting that order or going to trial, the broadcasters' organization decided to simply drop the code. As a result, there is no national self-regulatory code for entertainment programs or commercials on television today. The absence of such a code, however, has had little, if any, effect on what you see on television. This is partly because the networks and most of the major stations have their own codes and, more important, because broadcasters do not want to alienate their audiences. That concern has always been a more effective constraint on the industry than any code has been.</para>

Ratings help them decide whether their programming strategy is effective, or whether or not the audience approves of changes in a program. Ratings are also a major determinant of what a station or network can charge for commercials. For example, an average increase of one rating point for the season is worth over $30 million a year in additional advertising revenues to a network. An increase of one rating point means that an additional 1 percent of the country's households or adults tune to the network. For the 1990-1991 season, a Nielsen rating point was equivalent to 931,000 homes.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm206076352">During the normal year, between one-half and two-thirds of new television series disappear before the season is over, victims of low ratings.

        <para id="import-auto-idm1700028768">An indication of the importance of ratings is that each network spends at least $1.5 to $2 million dollars a year to get them. An even more obvious indication of their importance is the lengths to which networks and stations will go to increase ratings. This is especially noticeable during the so-called "sweeps" months-November, February, May, and July—when the audience for every television station in the country is measured. Those ratings, in turn, determine the rates each of those stations can charge advertisers during the following quarter, so they have a great effect· on income. Sweeps are done by the two major national rating services, Nielsen and Arbitron. The most important sweeps are those in November and February, the heart of the television season. If you ever wondered why an extraordinarily large number of outstanding television attractions are available during those months, that is the reason. Each network attempts to outdo the other in attracting the maximum number of viewers during those critical periods. Local stations also get into the act, many of them running contests during the sweeps months that require people to watch the station in order to have a chance to win.</para><para id="import-auto-idm212740608"><media id="people-meter" alt="Picture: Nielsen People Meter; caption: The advantage of sweeps months for viewers is that we tend to get better programs—the best episodes in series and the best specials and miniseries—or at least programs the broadcasters believe will attract the largest audiences.">

In the 1980s, however, a British firm, AGB, introduced another method called the "people meter." Instead of being connected to the television set, the people meter keypad is remotely controlled by the viewer, much like a television or VCR remote control. Each household member can record his or her viewing and indicate demographic information such as age and sex. A device inside the television set or a separate unit outside the set records the data.</para>

Its purpose is to find out whether a program is likely to be successful with various kinds of people and how it might be made more successful. (Some motion pictures are tested in a similar way.) People are invited into a theater for a preview of a program and are asked to indicate, by pushing buttons or filling out questionnaires, which parts they find interesting or dull. On the basis of such pretesting, some programs are rejected for broadcast, others are rewritten or reedited, or changes are made in the cast before they are scheduled for broadcast. In a sense, such pretesting is like an out-of-town tryout of a play before it opens on Broadway. These tryouts sometimes result in extensive rewriting and other changes, and sometimes in the cancellation of the Broadway opening.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm202849936">One kind of television research that has become important in the industry in recent years is closely related to program pretesting; this is research designed to discover the sorts of news and newscasters the public prefers. Such research is generally done by news consultants or "news doctors" such as Frank Magid and Associates, the largest firm of this type in the United States. Their aim is to increase the size of the audience for the newscasts produced by the station or network. By testing the reaction of the audience to different newscasters, news formats, and types of stories, the consultant obtains information with which to advise the station. The Magid firm is given credit for developing the idea of "Action News," which swept the country—newcasts filled with short, snappy, filmed or videotaped stories that give the newscasts a rapid pace. Magid is also credited with, or accused of, having developed the "Happy News" format, in which news personnel strive to be informal, friendly, and fun-loving.</para>

Just twenty years ago the average time was only five and one-half hours. But along with the increased viewing has come increased competition. During a recent summer "rerun" period-when the networks offer mostly reruns of their entertainment programs-Nielsen "prime time" ratings showed that NBC commanded 23 percent of the audience, ABC and CBS 18 percent, basic cable services 14 percent, Fox Broadcasting 11 percent, and independent television stations 23 percent.</para>

That percentage rises very slowly during the day until about 4:00 or 4:30 P .M., when somewhat over 30 percent have sets on. At that point, viewing begins to rise sharply and steadily to its peak, which comes between 8:00 and 10:00 P .M.

Then, however, viewing begins to rise, with adults over age 55 doing the greatest amount, an average of about 36 hours per week. In addition, among adults, women view substantially more television than men.</para>

        <title>The Role of Television in Our Lives</title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm217450688">Some comparisons may help you appreciate the large role that television plays in the lives of most Americans. In this country, more families have a television set than have a refrigerator, vacuum cleaner, telephone, or even indoor plumbing. About 98 percent of households have at least one receiver, and over 55 percent have two or more-and these figures continue to rise. The average child between the ages of 2 and 11 watches over three and one-half hours of television a day and sees an estimated twenty thousand commercials a year. Evidence indicates that Ronald McDonald, the clown who advertises McDonald's hamburgers on television, is second only to Santa Claus in being recognized by children in the United States. When some researchers asked children between the ages of four and six, "Which do you like better, TV or Daddy?" 44 percent of the youngsters said they preferred television.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm253370000">Some observers claim, and perhaps validly, that more people saw the first television production of Hamlet than had seen any of the countless stage productions of this tragedy throughout the world since William Shakespeare wrote it about four hundred years ago. Even a small audience, by television network standards, can be quite impressive in size. For example, a television audience of 30 million is not considered especially large these days. However, a dramatic production staged in an average-sized theater would need to run with capacity houses every night for 137 years to reach that many people.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1850664032">A news story about an attempted robbery in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, suggests that Americans not only watch a great deal of television; they attend to it closely. According to the news report, a man with a pistol entered a bar in Cedar Rapids one morning when the woman tending bar and her three customers were watching the CBS News. When the gunman warned them not to move, the bartender told him "Nobody is getting robbed while I'm watching the news." Failing to get anyone's attention-even after cocking his pistol twice-the robber complained that he wasn't being taken seriously and left to get some help. When police caught him later and brought him back to the bar, they discovered that one of the customers could not even identify the robber because he had never taken his eyes off the television set during the attempted holdup.</para>

        <title>The Greatest Television Attractions</title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1528495552">What attracts this sort of attention from so many people? The answer is: almost anything. Vast numbers of people tune to a great variety of types of programs. In fact, almost anything that appears in prime time on one of the commercial networks is likely to gain the attention of millions perhaps not enough millions to convince the network to keep the program on the air, but a tremendous audience by almost anyone else's standards. Super Bowl games and special miniseries adaptations of best-selling novels have attracted the largest television audiences. During the 1988-1989 television season, the CBS cowboy saga, "Lonesome Dove," had an average audience of 56 million. The ABC miniseries "War and Remembrance" averaged 40 million viewers-less than half the audience for one episode of its predecessor, "Winds of War." One of the largest, if not the largest, television audiences of all time was won by an episode of "Dallas" in 1980. This episode, which aired after a long buildup and torrent of "hype," revealed the identity of the person who shot the series villain, J. R. Ewing. The program had a 53.3 rating (53.3 percent of all television homes in the country) and a 76 share (76 percent of all homes viewing television at that time). It is a reasonable estimate that 120 million people in this country watched that episode. (By comparison, the largest audience ever for public television programming—the 1990 PBS series, "The Civil War"—averaged a 9.0 rating and a 13 share. Approximately 14 million people watched each episode of the 11-hour documentary.) </para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm218209360">This amount of exposure and this level of attention to television has made it a major advertising medium.

      <title>PROCESSING THE INFORMATION WE GET FROM TELEVISION</title>
      <para id="import-auto-idm193650800">Much that we discussed in earlier chapters on processing information from motion pictures and radio is applicable to television. For example, like the motion picture, many images we see on television we perceive both as themselves and as symbols for other things or ideas. Consider, for instance, "The Cosby Show." You probably were familiar with Bill Cosby before he was in that series, so you had some perception of the type of person he is. Thus, when you see him in one of the episodes in the series, you undoubtedly see him as Bill Cosby, but you also see him as Dr. Huxtable, the character he plays in that series; perhaps you also see him as a symbol of the ideal father. Although you probably do not think about those various levels of meaning when you watch the program, or any other program, they almost certainly interact to shape your interpretations of what you see and what you come away with afterward.</para>

        <title>The Confusion of Art and Reality</title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm1843585632">As with both the motion picture and radio, reality and art are confused in television. Because most of us perceive television, like radio, as a news medium as well as an entertainment medium, we may tend to perceive all of what we get from the medium as more "real" than we would otherwise perceive it to be.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm211450096">The effect of this confusion between art and reality is that the meanings we perceive when we watch television depend in large part on the inferences we make about the television director's intent. For example, when a television reporter overseas is videotaped outdoors giving a report, in the background we might see embassy gates locked with large chains, or soldiers going down the street, or children in a playground, or black clouds in the sky. When you see this report, you might simply assume that the background just happened to be there; the videotape had to be done somewhere. So you ignore the background or simply take it as additional information about the country: "That's just the way it is." On the other hand, if you assume that the background was selected intentionally, you infer that the director is trying to say something more to you, that the background is meant to symbolize something: the detention of political prisoners or hostages, military oppression, the freedom and normality that permit young children to play outdoors very much as they do in America, or danger-the storm clouds heralding possible war or doom. Some of these symbols are so familiar that we perceive them without being aware of it. The clothing a television performer wears, the decor of a room, even the physical characteristics of a performer can be interpreted as symbolic or as nonsymbolic. Because of the nature of television, the appropriate interpretive strategy is seldom clear.</para>

</media></para><para id="import-auto-idm242992784">This confusion between art and reality is used not only by directors in television drama or newscasts and news documentaries, but also by producers of commercials. The manufacturers of a brand of decaffeinated coffee used it to get around the NAB code restriction that no physician or actor representing a physician be used in advertising. They cast Robert Young, who had played Dr. Marcus Welby in a long-running television series, in a series of commercials in which he advised other characters who could not drink regular coffee to try decaffeinated coffee. The commercials never stated specifically that he was a physician; they did not need to. Robert Young had played Dr. Marcus Welby on television for so long that, for a large part of the American public, he is Marcus Welby, and in the commercials he gives his advice about decaffeinated coffee in the same paternal style that he used in prescribing medications in the Welby series. More recently, Maxwell House Coffee Company ran an ad featuring well-known television journalist Linda Ellerbee. In the ad, Ellerbee claimed that a taste test showed people preferred Maxwell House over Folgers coffee by two to one. Had an actor made such a claim, the public would likely have viewed it as the usual puffery that accompanies advertisements. But for a bona fide journalist to report the results of a taste test may have confused—or, as the advertiser intended, impressed—viewers who were used to seeing Linda Ellerbee deliver straight, factual information.</para>

        <title>Criticizing Television</title>
        <para id="import-auto-idm211845520">For many Americans, television is a prime target of criticism these days. Some of the criticism is directed at the effects television programs might have on children. Some is directed at the medium's bias in its treatment of political matters, minority groups, women, and our economic system. Much is also directed at the intellectual and aesthetic qualities of television programs. Evidence that indicates whether some of the charges are justified is covered in Chapter 16. Much of the criticism, however, is the sort for which no evidence is relevant. It centers on questions of value, not of fact. For example, whether critics believe television is biased politically depends on whether they disagree with the middle-of-the-road positions the medium generally takes. Whether they charge that it is biased toward the economic system, women, or minority groups depends upon whether they believe the media should be directly and indirectly encouraging social change. And whether they are critical of the intellectual and aesthetic qualities of the medium depends largely on whether they believe that an important responsibility of television is to educate and uplift. Valid arguments can be made on both sides of each of these issues.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-idm256157664"><emphasis effect="bold">BYLINE |</emphasis> Historian Barbara Tuchman said: "Television is moved by the desire to make profits, by appealing not to the audience of quality, but to the largest number-I suppose what used to be called the lowest common denominator. This is not the way to increase the thinking of the public on truth or serious matters, or to help it recognize the values in life that are creative."

          <title>Different perceptions of the nature of television.</title>
          <para id="import-auto-idm1499942752">Another issue that divides critics of television concerns the primary nature of the medium. They disagree about what television is or ought to be. Think about this issue. Is television primarily a medium of entertainment, of information, of expression, or of persuasion? Is it primarily a medium of commerce? Is it an art form? In a sense, it is all of these. Whether it should be all of these is another matter. In any case, we need not worry about the medium's "essential" or "primary" nature. Instead, let us see what interesting insights we can get by looking at it in all of these various ways, and perhaps in some other ways as well.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm1516829760">If we look at television as rhetoric-as information and persuasion-we can consider how good or useful a picture of the world it is presenting and what the relationship of that picture is to the world that we experience directly. What is the picture of marriage that it presents to us? Of education? Minority groups? Israel and Iraq? War? The presidency?</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm1698280960">If we look at television as art, we need to consider the originality of programs, their complexity or layers of meaning, their use of symbols, and whether they are expanding our tastes and extending our vision.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm1819920944">Television is often criticized for its lack of originality or variety. When one program becomes successful, a host of imitators are spawned the next season. For example, when a quiz show that awarded a tremendous amount of money to lucky contestants became popular on television, quiz shows soon were popping up all over the dial and the time schedule. From the "$64,000 Question" we expanded to the "$64,000 Challenge," to "High Finance," "Treasure Hunt," "Twenty-One," "Giant Step," and on to the more recent "Wheel of Fortune."</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm1691669488">This sort of imitation is not unique to television; it has always gone on in every form of entertainment and art. Consider, for example, what happened in motion pictures when the first disaster film was a hit, or to painting when the first Expressionist painting or the first Pop Art painting was recognized. Other filmmakers and other painters began to produce works of the same type, hoping to cash in. You can find imitation in every field that depends for support upon public acceptance or popularity. The problem is that truly original people are a rare breed; not very many of them are around in any generation. The difficulty that the scarcity of originality creates for television is especially acute because of the amount of material the medium consumes and the great expense of each program. We are not suggesting that people should stop insisting on better and more original programs; we are simply pointing out that they are easier to request than to produce.</para>
          <para id="import-auto-idm224935456"><emphasis effect="bold">REVIEW |</emphasis> Television shapes our perception of reality, not just in its news programming, but in its entertainment programming and commercials as well.

      <title>THE IMPACT OF TELEVISION ON US AND OUR SOCIETY</title>
      <para id="import-auto-idm1705201264">For most of us, television has become such an integral part of our lives that it is difficult to isolate its impact. Television, more than any other institution, provides a common set of experiences for virtually all Americans—a common base of information, common ways of perceiving issues and ideas, and, to some extent, common values. This set of shared experiences makes it easier for us to communicate with and understand each other. As one observer put it, "Its ceaseless flow of electronic signals pumped into our living and bed chambers affects fundamentally not merely our thoughts but the way we go about the business of thinking collectively." This is not to say that it has solved all of our problems of communication and understanding, but it has made a substantial contribution to their solution. Most of the major aspects of television's impact will be covered in the later chapters on general media functions and effects. Two related subjects deserve additional emphasis here. One is the fact that television, probably more than any other medium today, shapes as well as reports the news. Just the presence of a camera, for example, alters many people's behavior.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm216346976">Related to television's shaping of events it reports are the efforts of many individuals and groups to shape the medium's coverage of events. This is most notable in the efforts of political candidates or officeholders to promote and facilitate television coverage of certain events. For example, the president and his staff take great care to ensure that television cameras are present at events that will show the chief executive in a good light. In fact, certain events are staged mostly for the benefit of the cameras and the large audiences they ensure.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm1851218720">Some groups and individuals go to extreme lengths to gain access to the television audience. Terrorists in many parts of the world have hi- jacked airliners or taken hostages in order to attract the attention of television cameras. Often, terrorists have given as a condition for their release of hostages, the opportunity to have their messages transmitted through- out a country, or sometimes the world.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm1479041504">Hostages were used in a somewhat different way in the confrontation between the United States and Iraq. As a means of deterring the United States and other countries from taking military action in retaliation for its takeover of Kuwait, Iraq decided to detain foreigners who were in Kuwait or Iraq at the time of the invasion. Iraqi authorities referred to the detainees as "guests" rather than "hostages" and regularly provided footage or photo opportunities—what they called "guest news"—for the networks. One interview shown widely on American television featured Iraq's leader, Saddam Hussein, dressed in civilian clothes chatting amicably with nervous but polite detainees about their welfare. Despite Iraq's best efforts to portray him as humane and compassionate-Saddam Hussein coaxed one child to say he had enough milk and cornflakes-the broadcast infuriated many Americans, who saw innocent people being used for propaganda purposes.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm203612640">During the recent coup attempt by hard-liners in the Soviet Union, television played a crucial role in keeping the world informed of the dramatic events unfolding there and solidifying resistance to the coup. After the apparent overthrow of President Gorbachev, Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who opposed the takeover by reactionary communists, took refuge in the Russian Parliament Building only a short distance from where coup leaders were issuing emergency decrees. Through the use of television, Yeltsin and his supporters were able to undermine the junta's argument that Gorbachev was ill and unable to carry out his duties. Pictures of a defiant Boris Yeltsin standing on a tank and rallying Russians to his side were flashed around the world. The television and the telephone linked Yeltsin to the outside world and to world leaders who offered their encouragement. At one point, when it seemed that Soviet troops were poised to storm the Russian Parliament, ABC's Diane Sawyer entered the Parliament building and interviewed Yeltsin. A few hours later the world saw the Russian opposition leader calmly preparing for a threatened military attack on his headquarters. However, the attack never came, and shortly thereafter the coup crumbled. A weary but grateful Mikhail Gorbachev was restored to power. <emphasis effect="italics">Time</emphasis> magazine speculated that television not only helped unravel the putsch but forced its own brief attention span upon history.</para>

      <para id="import-auto-idm258141296">During the 1989 antigovernment demonstrations in China and in the Baltic states of Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania, many of the signs carried by protestors ("Give Me Liberty or Give Me Death"; "The Baltic States Never Joined the U.S.S.R.") were written in English, clearly for the benefit of camera crews from English-speaking countries.

      <title>TODAY’S DOMINANT MEDIUM: A SUMMARY</title>
      <para id="import-auto-idm252839216">The signs of television's dominant role among mass media are everywhere. Although it developed in the mold of radio—following the programming structure, the relationship of local licensee and network, and the general economic pattern of its parent medium—it soon outstripped that parent in the affections of the public. Radio and all other mass media have had to change in some way because of television's impact. Although television in essentially its present form has been with us for some four decades, great debates are still being held about its control—especially its control of content. The amount and kind of government regulation is constantly disputed. The right of the public to access, both paid and free, is also argued regularly. The relationship of local stations, networks, and cable systems is an especially important issue today. The size, functions, and means of support for our public television system in this country are also issues of debate.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm195756768">Some critics of television believe the networks have too much control. Others think advertisers are too powerful a force in shaping the medium. Still others think the government has too much power. And some think the masses—as represented by program ratings—have too much influence on programming decisions. Television is also criticized strongly for the amount of violence it shows, the sexual attitudes it portrays as normal, its treatment of women and minority groups, and a wide variety of other actions and inactions.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm259384368">You might believe that a negative relationship would exist between the amount of criticism and the amount of viewing, that since so many people are unhappy about different aspects of television they must not view much. In fact, that relationship is positive. No other medium has ever been so heavily criticized as television, yet no other medium has ever had such a large and loyal following. When a single program such as "Dallas" can attract more than half of the American population, and when audiences of 30 million for programs are common, we must conclude that this medium has a very special place in the hearts and lives of people.</para>
      <para id="import-auto-idm1864521968">The impact that television has on us and on a great many aspects of our society follows largely from its popularity. When you can reach vast numbers of people simultaneously with a message—whether about a political idea, a candidate, a detergent, or a way of life—that message is going to have an effect. Precisely what that effect is, in many of these cases, we do not yet know. This unanswered question is one of the most interesting aspects of television. This question is also one of the most important opportunities this medium creates for you, if you want to work at answering it for yourself.</para>
